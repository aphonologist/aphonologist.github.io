EARLY,NON-P,Cinderella ,anastasia,1950,488,"it's ridiculous, impossible. "
EARLY,NON-P,Cinderella ,drizella,1950,489,...from the kitchen.

EARLY,PRINCESS,Cinderella ,cinderella,1950,496,but you see. i have the other slipper. 
EARLY,NON-P,Cinderella ,singing,1950,497,have faith in dreams and someday your rainbow will come smiling through no matter how your heart is grieving if you keep on believing the dream that you wish will come true and they lived happily ever after 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,1,"in a far away land, long ago, lived a king and his fair queen. many years had they longed for a child and finally their wish was granted. a daughter was born, and they called her aurora. yes, they named her after the dawn for she filled their lives with sunshine. then a great holiday was proclaimed throughout the kingdom, so that all of high or low estate might pay homage to the infant princess. and our story begins on that most joyful day. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,choir,1959,2,"joyfully now to our princess we come, bringing gifts and all good wishes too. we pledge our loyalty anew. hail to the princess aurora! all of her subjects adore her! hail to the king! hail to the queen! hail to the princess aurora! health to the princess, wealth to the princess, long live the princess aurora! hail aurora! hail aurora! health to the princess, wealth to the princess, long live the princess aurora! hail to the king! hail to the queen! hail to the princess aurora! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,3,thus on this great and joyous day did all the kingdom celebrate the long awaited royal birth. and good king stefan and his queen made welcome their life long friend. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,announcer,1959,4,"their royal highnesses, king hubert and prince phillip "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,5,"fondly had these monarchs dreamed one day their kingdoms to unite. thus today would they announce that phillip, huberts son and heir to stefan's child would be betrothed. and so to her his gift he brought, and looked, unknowing, on his future bride. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,announcer,1959,6,"the most honored and exalted excellencies, the three good fairies. mistress flora, mistress fauna, and mistress merryweather. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fairies,1959,7,"oh, the little darling! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,8,"each of us the child may bless with a single gift. no more, no less. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,9,"little princess, my gift shall be the gift of beauty. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,choir,1959,10,"one gift, beauty rare full of sunshine in her hair lips that shame the red red rose she'll walk with springtime wherever she goes "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,11,"tiny princess, my gift shall be the gift of song. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,choir,1959,12,"one gift, the gift of song melody her whole life long the nightingale's her troubadour bringing her sweet serenade to her door "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,13,"sweet princess, my gift shall be ... "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,14,"why, it's maleficent! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,15,what does she want here? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,16,shhh! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,17,"well, quite a glittering assemblage, king stefan. royalty, nobility, the gentry, and, how quaint, even the rebel. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,18,i really felt quite distressed of not receiving an invitation. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,19,you weren't wanted! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,20,"not wa...? oh dear, what an awkward situation. i had hoped it was merely due to some oversight. well, in that event i'd best be on my way. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,queen,1959,21,"and you're not offended, your excellency? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,22,"why no, your majesty. and to show i bear no ill will, i, too, shall bestow a gift on the child. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,23,"listen well, all of you! the princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty, beloved by all who know her. but, before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,queen,1959,24,oh no! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,25,"ha, ha, ha, ha! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,stefan,1959,26,seize that creature! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,27,stand back you fools. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,28,"don't despair, your majesties. merryweather still has her gift to give. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,stefan,1959,29,then she can undo this fearful curse? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,30,"oh no, sire. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,31,maleficent's powers are far too great. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,32,but she can help! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,33,but ... 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,34,"just do your best, dear. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,35,yes ... 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,36,"sweet princess, if through this wicked witches trick a spindle should your finger prick, a ray of hope there still may be in this, the gift i give at thee. not in death but just in sleep the fateful prophecy you'll keep, and from this slumber you shall wake when true love's kiss the spell shall break. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,choir,1959,37,for true love conquers all 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,38,"but king stefan, still fearful of his daughter's life, did then and there decree that every spinning wheel in the kingdom should on that very day be burnt. so it was done. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,39,silly fiddle faddle! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,40,"now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear. i'm sure it'll work out somehow. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,41,"well, a bonfire won't stop maleficent. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,42,of course not. but what will? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,43,"well, perhaps if we reason with her. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,44,reason? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,45,with maleficent? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,46,"well, she can't be all bad. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,47,"oh, yes, she can. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,48,i'd like to turn her into a fat ole hoptoad! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,49,"now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,50,"besides, we can't. you know our magic doesn't work that way. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,51,"it can only do good, dear, to bring joy and happiness. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,52,"well, that would make me happy. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,53,but there must be some way ... there he is! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,54,there he is? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,55,"what is it, flora? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,56,"i'm going to ... shh, shh, shh! even walls have ears. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,57,follow me! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,58,i'll turn her into a flower! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,59,maleficent? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,60,"oh no, dear, the princess! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,61,oh she'd make a lovely flower. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,62,"don't you see, a flower can't prick its finger. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,63,it hasn't any. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,64,that's right. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,65,she'll be perfectly safe. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,66,until maleficent sends a frost. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,67,"yes, a ... oh dear! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,68,she always ruins your nicest flowers. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,69,you're right. and she'll be expecting us to do something like that. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,70,"but what won't she expect, she knows everything. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,71,"oh but she doesn't dear. maleficent doesn't know anything about love, or kindness, or the joy of helping earnest. you know, sometimes i don't think she's really very happy. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,72,"that's it, of course! it's the only thing she can't understand, and won't expect. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,73,explain what? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,74,about the three peasant women raising a foundling child deep in the forest. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,75,"oh, that's very nice of them. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,76,who are they? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,77,turn around! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,78,"iih ... why, it's ... us! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,79,"you mean, we, us? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,80,take care of the baby? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,81,why not? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,82,"oh, i'd like that! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,83,"well, yes, yes, but will we have to feed it? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,84,and wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep. oh i'd love it. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,85,you really think we can? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,86,"if humans can do it, so can we. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,87,and we have our magic to help us. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,88,that's right. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,89,"oh, no, no, no, no, no magic! i'll take those wands right now. oh, better get rid of those wings, too. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,90,"you mean, live like mortals? for sixteen years? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,91,"now, we don't know how. we've never done anything without magic. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,92,and that's why maleficent will never suspect. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,93,"but who'll wash, and cook? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,94,"oh, we'll all pitch in. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,95,i'll take care of the baby! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,96,"let me have it, dear. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,97,"come along now, we must tell their majesties at once. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,98,flora! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,99,flora! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,100,"so the king and his queen watched with heavy hearts as their most precious posession, their only child, disappeared into the night. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,101,"many sad and lonely years passed by for king stefan and his people. but as the time for the princesses sixteenth birthday drew near, the entire kingdom began to rejoice. for everyone knew that as long as maleficent's domain, the forbidden mountains, thundered with her wrath and frustration, her evil prophecy had not yet been fulfilled. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,102,"it's incredible, sixteen years and not a trace of her! she couldn't have vanished into thin air. are you sure you searched everywhere? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,1st servant,1959,103,"yeah, yeah, anywhere, we all ... "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,2nd servant,1959,104,"yeah, yeah! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,105,"but what about the town, the forests, the mountains? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,1st servant,1959,106,"we searched mountains, forests, and houses, and let me see, in all the cradles. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,107,cradle? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,1st servant,1959,108,"yeah, yeah, every cradle. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,maleficent,1959,109,cradle? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,servants,1959,110,"ha, ha, ha ... "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,111,"and so for sixteen long years the whereabouts of the princess remained a mystery, while deep in the forest, in a woodcutter's cottage, the good fairies carried out their welllaid plan. living like mortals, they had reared the child as their own and called her briar rose. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,narrator,1959,112,on this her sixteenth birthday the good fairies had planned a party and something extra special for her surprise. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,113,how about this one? 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,114,this is the one i picked. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,115,oh she'll look beautiful in it. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,116,now i thought a few changes here ... 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,117,aha 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,118,don't forget a pretty bow ... 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,119,and there's the shoulder line. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,120,we'll make it blue. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,121,"oh no, dear, pink. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,122,but ... 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,123,"of course, we'll need a few pleats "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,124,"yes, but how are we going to get her out of the house? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,125,"oh, i'll think of something. "
EARLY,PRINCESS,Sleeping Beauty ,briar rose,1959,126,"well, and what are you three dears up to? "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,127,up to?

EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,132,"that's it, berries! "
EARLY,PRINCESS,Sleeping Beauty ,briar rose,1959,133,berries?

EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,140,and don't go to far. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,141,and don't speak to strangers. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,fauna,1959,142,"goodbye, dear! "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,143,goodbye! 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,144,goodbye!

EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,156,we're taking no chances. 
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,merryweather,1959,157,"but, i never baked a fancy cake. "
EARLY,NON-P,Sleeping Beauty ,flora,1959,158,"oh, you won't have to, dear. "

MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,76,"oh, ariel, how many times must we go through this? you could've been seen by one of those barbarians by by one of those humans! "
MID,PRINCESS,The Little Mermaid ,ariel,1989,77,"daddy, they're not barbarians! "
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,78,they're dangerous. do you think i want to see my est daughter snared by some fisheater's hook? 
MID,PRINCESS,The Little Mermaid ,ariel,1989,79,i'm sixteen years old i'm not a child anymore 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,80,"don't you take that tone of voice with me lady. as long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules! "
MID,PRINCESS,The Little Mermaid ,ariel,1989,81,but if you would just listen 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,82,"not another word and i am never, never to hear of you going to the surface again. is that clear? "
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,83,"hm! teenagers. . . . they think they know everything. you give them an inch, they swim all over you. "
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,84,"do you, er, think i i was too hard on her? "
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,85,"definitely not. why, if ariel was my daughter, i'd show her who was boss. none of this ""flitting to the surface"" and other such nonsense. no, sir i'd keep her under tight control. "
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,86,"you're absolutely right, sebastian. "
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,87,of course. 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,88,ariel needs constant supervision. 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,89,constant. 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,90,someone to watch over her to keep her out of trouble. 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,91,all the time 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,triton,1989,92,and you are just the crab to do it. 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,93,how do i get myself into these situations? i should be writing symphonies not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,sebastian,1989,94,hmm? what is that girl up to? 
MID,NON-P,The Little Mermaid ,flounder,1989,95,"ariel, are you okay? "
MID,PRINCESS,The Little Mermaid ,ariel,1989,96,if only i could make him understand. i just don't see things the way he does. i don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,narrator,1991,1,"once upon a time, in a faraway land, a prince lived in a shining castle. although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. but then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. and when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. the prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twentyfirst year. if he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. if not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. as the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast?

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,417,"that didn't go very well at all, did it. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,418,"lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there is the slightest change. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,419,"you can count on me, mon capitan. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,420,"well, i guess we better go downstairs and start cleaning up. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,421,"i ask nicely, but she refuses. what a...what does she want me to dobeg? "

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,468,"ten years we've been rusting needing so much more than dusting needing exercise, a chance to use our skills! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,469,"most days just lay around the castle, flabby fat and lazy you walked in, and oopsadaisie! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,470,"it's a guest, it's a guest! sakes alive, well i'll be blessed! wine's been poured and thank the lord i've had the napkins freshly pressed! "

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,478,"oh, my goodness, will you look at the time. now, it's off to bed, off to bed! "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,479,"oh, i couldn't possibly go to bed now. it's my first time in an enchanted castle. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,480,enchanted? who said anything about the castle being enchanted? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,481,"it was you, wasn't it! "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,482,"i, um, figured it out for myself. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,483,"i'd like to look around, if that's all right. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,484,oh! would you like a tour? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,485,"wait a second, wait a second. i'm not sure that's such a good idea. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,486,"we can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what i mean. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,487,perhaps you could take me. i'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,488,"well, actually, ah yes, i do! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,489,"as you can see, the pseudo facade was stripped away to reveal a minimalist rococo design. note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings. this is yet another example of the neoclassic baroque period, and as i always say, if it's not baroque, don't fix it! ha ha ha. now then, where was i? "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,490,as you were! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,491,"now, if i may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above themademoiselle? "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,492,what's up there? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,493,"where? up there? nothing. absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing. dusty, dull, very boring. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,494,"oh, so that's the west wing. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,495,nice going! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,496,i wonder what he's hiding up there. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,497,hiding? the master is hiding nothing! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,498,then it wouldn't be forbidden. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,499,perhaps mademoiselle would like to see something else. we have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to... 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,500,maybe later. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,501,"the gardens, or the library perhaps? "

MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,513,"i'm sorry, "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,514,i warned you never to come here! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,515,i didn't mean any harm.

MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,523,just...hold still. 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,524,that hurts! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,525,"if you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,526,"well if you hadn't run away, this wouldn't have happened! "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,527,"well if you hadn't frightened me, i wouldn't have run away! "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,528,well you shouldn't have been in the west wing! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,529,well you should learn to control your temper! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,530,"now, hold still. this may sting a little. "

MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,532,you're welcome. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,d'arque,1991,533,"i don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but they said you'd make it worth my while. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,d'arque,1991,534,"aah, i'm listening. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,535,"it's like this. i've got my heart set on marrying belle, but she needs a little persuasion. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,536,turned him down flat! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,537,everyone knows her father's a lunatic. he was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle... 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,d'arque,1991,538,maurice is harmless. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,539,"the point is, belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,540,"yeah, even marry him! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,d'arque,1991,541,so you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she agrees to marry you? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,d'arque,1991,542,"oh, that is despicable. i love it! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,543,"if no one will help me, then i'll go back alone. i don't care what it takes. i'll find that castle and somehow i'll get her out of there. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,544,belle! maurice! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,545,"oh, well, i guess it's not gonna work after all. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,546,"they have to come back sometime, and when they do, we'll be ready for them. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,547,"lefou, don't move from that spot until belle and her father come home. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,548,"but, but... aww, nuts! "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,549,i've never felt this way about anyone. 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,550,i want to do something for her. 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,551,but what? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,552,"well, there's the usual thingsflowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep... "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,553,"ahh, no no. it has to be something very special. something that sparks her interwait a minute. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,554,"belle, there's something i want to show you. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,555,can i open them? 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,556,"no, no. not yet. wait here. "

MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,563,"oh, thank you so much. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,564,"oh, would you look at that? "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,565,ha ha! i knew it would work. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,566,what? what works? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,567,it's very encouraging. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,featherduster,1991,568,isn't this exciting! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,569,i didn't see anything. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,570,"come along, chip. there's chores to be done in the kitchen. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,571,but what are they talking about? what's going on? 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,572,"there's something sweet and almost kind but he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined. but now he's dear and so unsure, i wonder why i didn't see it there before. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,573,she glanced this way i thought i saw and when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw no it can't be i'll just ignore but then she's never looked at me that way before. 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,574,"new, and a bit alarming who'd have ever thought that this could be? true, that he's no prince charming but there's something in him that i simply didn't see. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,575,well who'd have thought? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,576,well bless my soul. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,577,and who'd have known? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,578,well who indeed? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,579,and who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,580,it's so peculiar 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,all,1991,581,we'll wait and see a few days more there may be something there that wasn't there before 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,582,"yes, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,583,what? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,584,there may be something there that wasn't there before. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,585,"what's there, mama? "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,586,i'll tell you when you're older. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,587,tonight is the night! 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,588,i'm not sure i can do this. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,589,"you don't have time to be timid. you must be bold, daring. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,590,bold. daring. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,591,"there will be music. romantic candlelight, provided myself, and when the time is right, you confess your love. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,592,"yes, i i conno, i can't. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,593,"you care for the girl, don't you? "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,594,more than anything. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,595,well then you must tell her. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,596,voila. you look so...so... 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,597,stupid. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,598,not quite the word i was looking for. perhaps a little more off the top. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,599,ahem ahem ahem. your lady awaits. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,600,"tale as old as time true as it can be barely even friends then somebody bends unexpectedly. just a little change small to say the least both a little scared neither one prepared, beauty and the beast. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,601,"ever just the same ever a surprise ever as before, ever just as sure as the sun will rise tale as old as time tune as old as song bittersweet and strange, finding you can change, learning you were wrong certain as the sun rising in the east tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, beauty and the beast. tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, beauty and the beast. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,602,"off to the cupboard with you now, chip. it's past your bedtime. good night, love. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,603,belle? are you happy here with me? 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,604,yes. 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,605,what is it? 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,606,"if only i could see my father again, just for a moment. i miss him so much. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,607,there is a way. 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,608,"this mirror will show you anything, anything you wish to see. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,609,"i'd like to see my father, please. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,610,"papa. oh, no. he's sick, he may be dying. and he's all alone. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,611,then...then you must go to him. 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,612,what did you say? 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,613,i release you. you are no longer my prisoner. 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,614,you mean...i'm free? 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,615,yes. 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,616,"oh, thank you. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,617,"hold on, papa. i'm on my way. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,618,"take it with you, so you'll always have a way to look back, and remember me. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,619,thank you for understanding how much he needs me. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,620,"well, your highness. i must say everything is going just peachy. i knew you had it in you. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,621,i let her go. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,622,"ha ha ha, yes. splend"
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,623,you what? how could you do that? 
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,624,i had to. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,625,"yes, but why? "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,626,"because, i love her. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,627,"yes, i'm afraid it's true. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,628,she's going away? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,629,but he was so close. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,630,"after all this time, he's finally learned to love. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,631,"that's it, then. that should break the spell. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,632,but it's not enough. she has to love him in return. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,633,and now it's too late. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,634,"oh, they're back. "

MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,638,i missed you so much. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,639,but the beast. how did you escape? 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,640,"i didn't escape, papa. he let me go. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,641,that horrible beast? 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,642,"but he's different, now. he's changed somehow. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,643,hi! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,644,"oh, a stowaway. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,645,"why, hello there, little fella. didn't think i'd ever see you again. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,chip,1991,646,"belle, why'd you go away? don't you like us anymore? "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,647,"oh, chip. of course i do. it's just that "

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,d'arque,1991,651,"don't worry, mademoiselle. we'll take good care of him. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,652,my father's not crazy. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,653,"he was raving like a lunatic. we all heard him, didn't we! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,bystanders,1991,654,yeah! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,655,"no, i won't let you. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,656,belle? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,657,"ah, maurice. tell us again, old man, just how big was the beast? "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,658,"well, he was...that is...enormous. i'd say at least eight, no more like ten feet. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lefou,1991,659,"well, you don't get much crazier than that. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,660,"it's true, i tell you! "

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,662,let go of me! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,663,"no, you can't do this! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,664,"tsk, tsk, tsk. poor belle. it's a shame about your father. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,665,"you know he's not crazy, gaston. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,666,"i might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding, if... "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,667,if what? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,668,if you marry me. 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,669,what? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,670,"one little word, belle. that's all it takes. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,671,never! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,672,have it your way. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,673,belle? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,674,let go of me! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,675,my father's not crazy and i can prove it! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,676,show me the beast! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,woman 1,1991,677,is it dangerous? 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,678,"oh, no. he'd never hurt anyone. please, i know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle. he's my friend. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,679,"if i didn't know better, i'd think you had feelings for this monster. "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,680,"he's no monster, gaston. you are! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,681,she's as crazy as the old man. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,682,the beast will make off with your children! he'll come after them in the night. 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,683,no! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,684,we're not safe 'til his head is mounted on my wall! i say we kill the beast! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,man 1,1991,685,"we're not safe until he's dead, "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,man 2,1991,686,he'll come stalking us at night! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,woman 1,1991,687,set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,man 3,1991,688,he'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,689,"so it's time to take some action, boys it's time to follow me! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,690,"through the mist, through the woods through the darkness and the shadows it's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride. say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle, and there's something truly terrible inside. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,691,"it's a beast, he's got fangs, razor sharp ones massive paws, killer claws for the feast "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,692,"hear him roar, see him foam, but we're not coming home, 'til he's dead, good and dead, kill the beast! "
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,693,"no, i won't let you do this. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,694,"if you're not with us, you're against us. bring the old man. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,695,get your hands off me! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,696,we can't have them running off to warn the creature! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,697,let us out! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,698,we'll rid the village of this beast. who's with me? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mob,1991,699,"light your torch, mount your horse! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,700,screw your courage to the sticking place 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mob,1991,701,"we're counting on gaston to lead the way! through a mist, to a wood, where within a haunted castle, something's lurking that you don't see every day! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mob,1991,702,"it's a beast, one as tall as a mountain! we won't rest 'til he's good and deceased! sally forth, tally ho, grab your sword, grab your bow praise the lord and here we go! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,703,we'll lay siege to his castle and bring back his head! 
MID,PRINCESS,Beauty and the Beast ,belle,1991,704,"i have to warn the beast. this is all my fault. oh, papa. what are we going to do? "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,maurice,1991,705,"now, now. we'll think of something. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mob,1991,706,"we don't like, what we don't understand, it frankly scares us and this monster is mysterious at least! bring your guns, bring your knives, save your children and your wives, we'll save our village and our lives, we'll kill the beast! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,707,"i knew it, i knew it was foolish to get our hopes up. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,708,maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,709,could it be? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,710,is it she? 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,711,"sacre bleu, invaders! "

MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,714,"warn the master. if it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them. "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,cogsworth,1991,715,who's with me? aahh! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,gaston,1991,716,"take whatever booty you can find, but remember, the beast is mine! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,objects,1991,717,"hearts ablaze, banners high! we go marching into battle, unafraid, although the danger just increased! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mob,1991,718,"raise the flag, sing the song here we come, we're fifty strong and fifty frenchmen can't be wrong, let's kill the beast! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,719,"pardon me, master. "
MID,PRINCE,Beauty and the Beast ,beast,1991,720,leave me in peace. 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mrs. potts,1991,721,"but sir, the castle is under attack! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,mob,1991,722,"kill the beast, kill the beast! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,723,this isn't working! 
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,featherduster,1991,724,"oh, lumiere! we must do something! "
MID,NON-P,Beauty and the Beast ,lumiere,1991,725,wait! i know!

MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,aladdin,1992,75,"look at that, abu. it's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends! "
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,prince,1992,76,"you are a worthless street rat. you were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you. "
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,aladdin,1992,77,"i'm not worthless. and i don't have fleas. come on, abu. let's go home. "
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,aladdin,1992,78,"riffraff, street rat. i don't buy that. if only they'd look closer would they see a poor boy? no siree. they'd find out, there's so much more to me. "
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,aladdin,1992,79,"someday, abu, things are gonna change. we'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all. "
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,prince,1992,80,i've never been so insulted! 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,81,"oh, prince achmed. you're not leaving so soon, are you? "
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,prince,1992,82,good luck marrying her off! 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,83,"oh, jasmine! jasmine! jasmine! "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,84,"confound it, rajah! so, this is why prince achmed stormed out! "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,85,"oh, father. rajah was just playing with him, weren't you rajah. "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,86,"you were just playing with that overdressed, selfabsorbed prince achmed, weren't you? "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,87,ahem. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,88,"dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call. the law says you... "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,both,1992,89,...must be married to a prince. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,90,by your next birthday. 
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,91,the law is wrong. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,92,you've only got three more days! 
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,93,"father, i hate being forced into this. "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,94,"if i do marry, i want it to be for love. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,95,"jasmine, it's not only this law. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,96,"i'm not going to be around forever, and i just want to make sure you're taken care of, provided for. "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,97,try to understand. i've never done a thing on my own. 
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,98,i've never had any real friends. 
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,99,"except you, rajah. "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,100,i've never even been outside the palace walls. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,101,"but jasmine, you're a princess. "
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,102,then maybe i don't want to be a princess. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,103,oooohhh! allah forbid you should have any daughters! 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,104,i don't know where she gets it from. her mother wasn't nearly so picky. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,105,"ooh, oh. ah, jafarmy most trusted advisor. i am in desperate need of your wisdom. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,106,"my life is but to serve you, my lord. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,107,it's this suitor business. jasmine refuses to choose a husband. i'm at my wit'send. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,iago,1992,108,awk! wit'send. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,109,"oh, ha ha. have a cracker, pretty polly! "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,110,your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,111,"now then, perhaps i can divine a solution to this thorny problem. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,112,"if anyone can help, it's you. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,113,"ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,114,"uh, my ring? but it's been in the family for years. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,115,it is necessary to find the princess a suitor. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,116,don't worry. everything will be fine. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,117,everything...will be...fine. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,118,the diamond. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,119,"here, jafar. whatever you need will be fine. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,120,"you are most gracious, my liege. now run along and play with your little toys. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,sultan,1992,121,yes...that'll be...pretty good. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,iago,1992,122,"i can't take it anymore! if i gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam! whack! "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,123,"calm yourself, iago. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,iago,1992,124,then i'd grab him around the head. whack! whack! 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,jafar,1992,125,"soon, i will be sultan, not that addlepated twit. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,iago,1992,126,and then i stuff the crackers down his throat! ha ha! 
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,127,"oh, i'm sorry, rajah. but i can't stay here and have my life lived for me. i'll miss you."
MID,PRINCESS,Aladdin ,jasmine,1992,128,good bye! 
MID,PRINCE,Aladdin ,aladdin,1992,129,"okay, abu. go! "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,proprietor,1992,130,"try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. "
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,proprietor,1992,131,"hey, get your paws off that. "

MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,shopkeeper 3,1992,138,would the lady like a necklace. a pretty necklace for a pretty lady. 
MID,NON-P,Aladdin ,shopkeeper 4,1992,139,"fresh fish! we catch 'em, you buy 'em! "

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,68,"a king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. one day, simba, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise with you as the new king. "

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,70,everything. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,71,everything the light touches. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,72,what about that shadowy place? 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,73,"that's beyond our borders. you must never go there, simba. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,74,but i thought a king can do whatever he wants. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,75,"oh, there's more to being king than... getting your way all the time. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,76,there's more? 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,77,simba... 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,78,"everything you see exists together, in a delicate balance. as king, you need to understand that balance, and respect all the creaturesfrom the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,79,"but, dad, don't we eat the antelope? "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,80,"yes, simba, but let me explain. when we die, our bodies become the grass. and the antelope eat the grass. and so we are all connected in the great circle of life. "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,81,"good morning, sire! "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,82,"good morning, zazu. "

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,86,"oh, really? "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,87,"... and the baboons are going ape over this. of course, the giraffes are acting like they're above it all... "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,88,"what are you doing, son? "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,89,pouncing. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,90,let an old pro show you how it's done. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,91,"...the tick birds are pecking on the elephants. i told the elephants to forget it, but they can't... "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,92,"zazu, would you turn around? "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,93,"yes, sire. "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,94,"the cheetahs are hard up, but i always say ... "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,95,stay low to the ground.

MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,97,"okay, stay low to the ground, right... yeah... "

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,101,"pouncing!?! oh no, sire, you can't be serious... "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,102,oh... this is so humiliating. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,mufasa,1994,103,try not to make a sound. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,104,"what are you telling him, mufasa? "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,105,mufasa? simba?

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,116,"oh, young master, one day you will be king; then you can chase those slobbering mangy stupid poachers from dawn until dusk. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,117,hey uncle scar! guess what! 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,118,i despise guessing games. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,119,i'm going to be king of pride rock. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,120,oh goody. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,121,my dad just showed me the whole kingdom; 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,122,"yes. well... forgive me for not leaping for joy. bad back, you know. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,123,"hey, uncle scar? when i'm king, what'll that make you? "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,124,a monkey's uncle. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,125,heh heh. you're so weird. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,126,"you have no idea. ...so, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he? "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,127,everything. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,128,he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border...? 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,129,"well, no... he said i can't go there. "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,130,and he's absolutely right. it's far too dangerous. only the bravest lions go there. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,131,"well, i'm brave! what's out th "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,132,"no, i'm sorry, simba, i just can't tell you. "

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,134,"simba, simba, i'm only looking out for the wellbeing of my favorite nephew. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,135,"yeah, right, i'm your only nephew. "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,136,all the more reason for me to be protective... an elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince... 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,137,oops! 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,138,an elephant what? whoa. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,scar,1994,139,"oh dear, i've said too much... well, i suppose you'd have found sooner or later, you being so clever and all... "

MID,PRINCESS,The Lion King ,nala,1994,180,yeah. it'd be too weird. 
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,181,"well, sorry to burst your bubble, but you two turtledoves have no choice. it's a tradition... "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,182,...going back generations. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,183,"well, when i'm king, that'll be the first thing to go. "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,184,not so long as i'm around. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,185,"well, in that case, you're fired. "
MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,186,"hmmm... nice try, but only the king can do that. "

MID,NON-P,The Lion King ,zazu,1994,190,"not yet i don't. and with an attitude like that, i'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed. "
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,191,hmph. not the way i see it. 
MID,PRINCE,The Lion King ,simba,1994,192,i'm gonna be a mighty king so enemies beware!

MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,100,"father, i think my dream is pointing me down another path. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,101,this is the right path for you. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,102,but why can't i choose— 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,103,"pocahontas, come with me. you are the daughter of the chief. it is time to take your place among our people. even the wild mountain stream must someday join the big river. as the river cuts his path though the river's proud and strong he will choose the smoothest course that's why rivers live so long they're steady as the steady beating drum your mother wore this for our wedding. it was her dream to see you wear it at your own. it suits you. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,104,"he wants me to be steady. . . like the river. but it's not steady at all. what i love most about rivers is you can't step in the same river twice the water's always changing, always flowing but people, i guess, can't live like that we all must pay a price to be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing what's around the riverbend waiting just around the riverbend i look once more just about the riverbend beyond the shore where the gulls fly free don't know what for what i dream the day might send just around the riverbend for me coming for me i feel it there beyond those trees or right behind these waterfalls can i ignore that sound of distant drumming? for a handsome, sturdy husband who builds handsome, sturdy walls and never dreams that something might be coming just around the riverbend just around the riverbend i look once more just around the riverbend beyond the shore somewhere past the sea don't know what for why do all my dreams extend just around the riverbend just around the riverbend should i choose the smoothest course? steady as the beating drum should i marry kocoum? is all my dreaming at an end? or do you still wait for me, dream giver just around the riverbend? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,105,is that my pocahontas? 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,106,"grandmother willow, i need to talk to you. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,107,"good morning, child. i was hoping you'd visit today. why, your mother's necklace! "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,108,that's what i wanted to talk to you about. my father wants me to marry kocoum. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,109,kocoum? but he's so serious. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,110,i know. my father thinks it's the right path for me. but lately i've been having this dream and i think it's— 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,111,"oh, a dream! let's hear all about it! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,112,quiet! quiet! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,113,"now, child, you were saying. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,114,"well, i'm running through the woods and then right there in front of me is an arrow. as i look at it, it starts to spin. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,115,a spinning arrow? how unusual. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,116,yes! it spins faster and faster and faster until suddenly it stops. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,117,"hmm. well, seems to me this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,118,"but grandmother willow, what is my path? how am i ever going to find it? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,119,your mother asked me the very same question. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,120,she did? what did you tell her? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,121,"i told her to listen. all around you are spirits, child. they live in the earth, the water, the sky. if you listen, they will guide you. wind spirits ay ay ay na ay ay na "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,122,i hear the wind.

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,131,"and scores of adventures waiting for us, right, percy? do you think we'll meet some savages? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,132,"if we do, we should be sure to give them a proper english greeting. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,133,"oh, gift baskets! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,134,and he came so highly recommended. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,135,"it's perfect, governor. the water's deep enough, we can pull right up to shore. hey there, percy. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,136,"very well, then. give the order. "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,138,"about the natives, i'm counting on you to make sure those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,139,"well, if they're anything like the savages i've fought before, it's nothing i can't handle. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,140,"right. that'll be all, smith, there's a good man. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,141,"see ya, percy. "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,144,and don't think i don't know what those backstabbers at court say about me. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,145,"oh yes, all that talk about you being a pathetic social climber who's failed at everything he's— "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe ,1995,146,"i'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory. but mark my words, wiggins, when king james see the gold these peasants unearth success will be mine, at last. "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,kekata ,1995,235,this wound is strange to me. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,236,"we will fight this enemy, but we cannot do it alone. kocoum, send messengers to every village in our nation. we will call on our brothers to help us fight. "

MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,278,"you think that, only because you don't know any better. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,279,"wait a minute, don't take it that – "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,280,savages?!

MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,285,"no, i'm not letting you leave. look, don't do this. ‘savage' is just a word. you know. a term for. . . people who are uncivilised. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,286,like me. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,287,"well, when i say uncivilised, what i mean is – is. . . "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,288,"what you mean is, not like you. you think i'm an ignorant savage and you've been so many places, i guess it must be so but still i cannot see if the savage one is me how can there be so much that you don't know? you don't know you think you own whatever land you land on the earth is just a dead thing you can claim but i know every rock and tree and creature has a life, has a spirit, has a name you think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger you'll learn things you never knew you never knew have you ever heard the wolf cry to the bluecorn moon? or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned? can you sing with all the voices of the mountain? can you paint with all the colours of the wind? can you paint with all the colours of the wind? come run the hidden pine trails of the forest come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth come roll in all the riches all around you and for once, never wonder what they're worth the rainstorm and the river are my brothers the heron and the otter are my friends and we are all connected to each other in a circle, in a hoop that never ends how high does the sycamore grow? if you cut it down, then you'll never know and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the bluecorn moon for whether we are white or copperskinned we need to sing with all the voices of the mountain we need to paint with all the colours of the wind you can own the earth and still all you'll own is earth until you can paint with all the colours of the wind "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,289,what is it? 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,290,the drums. they mean trouble. i shouldn't be here.

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,296,"two on each side. ready now, push! watch it, it's slipping! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,297,"come on, lads, it's only a little picket fence. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,298,"steady, steady! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,299,there you go! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,thomas ,1995,300,"that'll keep everything out, eh, john? something wrong, john? "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,301,what? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,thomas ,1995,302,you've been awfully quiet the last few days. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,303,"oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,thomas ,1995,304,"ah, don't worry, john. you'll get your chance to deal with the indians. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,305,"yeah, we'll take care of them like that we did last time, eh mates? we shot ourselves an injun or maybe two or three "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,306,"all right, you howling nutter, get to work! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,307,"come on, ben. it's just a little fun. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,308,"oh sure, we're having loads of fun. right, look at us. no gold, no food, while ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day happy as a clam. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,309,"i'm doomed! i should be wallowing in riches right now and i haven't seen so much as a speck! it's got to be here somewhere. where could it be? i've mined the forests and the hills and swamps, and nothing! why can't i find it? what am i overlooking? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,310,ah! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,311,i. . . i. . . i made it myself. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,312,"take that silly. . . of course, the indians! wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,313,because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,314,"it's the gold! they have it and they don't want us to take it from them. well, i'll just have to take it by force then, won't i? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,315,you there! where's captain smith? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,316,"well, he's. . . gone! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,317,"aye, your singing must have scared him off. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,318,"well, then go get him, for heaven's sake! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,319,what if we run into the indians? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,320,"that's what guns are for, now arm yourselves and get moving! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,321,pocahontas! you should be inside the village. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,322,we'll be all right. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,323,we're gathering food for when the warriors arrive. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,324,don't go far. now is not the time to be running off. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,325,"yes, father. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,326,"when i see you wear that necklace, you look just like your mother. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,327,i miss her. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,328,"but she is still with us. whenever the wind blows through the trees, i feel her presence. our people looked to her for wisdom and strength. someday, they will look to you as well. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,329,i would be honoured by that. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,330,you shouldn't be out here alone. i'll send for kocoum. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,331,"all right, what is it? "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,332,what? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,333,you're hiding something. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,334,i'm not hiding anything. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,335,"pocahontas, you can tell me, i promise i won't tell anyone — "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,336,"pocahontas, look! it's one of them! i'm going to get— "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,345,but— 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,kocoum ,1995,346,"nakoma, where is pocahontas? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,347,i. . . i haven't seen her. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,kocoum ,1995,348,pocahontas can't keep running off. it's dangerous out there. tell her that. she listens to you. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,349,"huh, sure she does. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,350,"this place is incredible! and to think, we came all this way just to dig it up for gold. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,351,gold? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,352,"hey, meeko. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,353,what's gold? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,354,"you know, it's. . . it's yellow, comes out of the ground, it's really valuable. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,355,"oh, here, we've lots of it. "

MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,358,"hmm, there's nothing like that around here. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,359,no gold? 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,360,not that i've seen. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,361,all this way for nothing. those boys are in for a big surprise. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,362,will they leave? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,363,some of them might. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,364,will you go home? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,365,"well, it's not like i have much of a home to go back to. i've never really belonged anywhere. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,366,you could belong here. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wind spirit ,1995,367,ay ay ay na ay ay na. . . 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,368,what was that?

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,372,"let it break upon you like a wave upon the sand hello, john smith. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,373,"pocahontas, the tree is talking to me. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,374,then you should talk back.

MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,376,say something. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,377,what do you say to a tree? 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,378,anything you want. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,379,"so, uh. . . "

MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,383,"smith! smith! where are ya, mate? "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,384,we can't let them see us. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,385,"quick, over here. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,386,this place gives me the creeps. savages could be hiding anywhere. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,387,"aye, well, if you spot one, don't ask questions. just shoot. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben& lon ,1995,388,oh! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,389,"watch your feet, you big oaf! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,390,"it wasn't me, it was the tree. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,391,"oh of course, the tree just felt like lifting its roots and. . . let's get out of here. run! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,392,but what about smith? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,393,"he's a big lad, he can take care of himself. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,394,i'm glad you're on our side. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,395,there's still some snap in these old vines. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,396,i better get back before they send the whole camp out after me. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,397,when will i see you again? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,398,"meet me tonight, right here. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,399,"well, i haven't had this much excitement in 200 years. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,400,"what am i doing? i shouldn't be seeing him again. i mean, i want to see him again— "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,401,who wouldn't? i want to see him again. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,402,"but still, something inside is telling me it's the right thing. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,403,perhaps it's your dream. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,404,my dream? do you think he's the one the spinning arrow was pointing to? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,405,mmhmm!

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,kocoum ,1995,409,look at them. now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,410,"now that we are joined by our brothers, we will defeat this enemy. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,411,"father, i need to speak with you. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,412,"not now, my daughter. the council is gathering. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,413,we don't have to fight them! there must be a better way. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,414,sometimes our paths are chosen for us. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,415,but maybe we should try talking to them. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,416,they do not want to talk. 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,417,"but if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn't you? "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,418,pocahontas— 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,419,wouldn't you? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,powhatan ,1995,420,of course i would. but it is not that simple. nothing is simple anymore. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,421,"easy, thomas. it's me. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,thomas ,1995,422,"oh, john! i could've killed you! "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,423,"not aiming like that, you couldn't. keep both eyes open when you shoot. you'll see twice as well. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,424,smith! there ya are! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,425,we were looking all over for you. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,426,smith! where have you been? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,427,"i was out scouting the terrain, sir. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,428,excellent. then you must know the indians' whereabouts. we'll need that information for the battle. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,429,what battle? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,430,we will eliminate these savages once and for all. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,431,no! you can't do that! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,432,oh? can't i? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,433,"look, we don't have to fight them. "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,thomas ,1995,437,a savage? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,438,"they're not savages, they can help us. they know the land, they know how to navigate the rivers. and, look! it's food! "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,439,what is it? 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,440,"it's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,wiggins ,1995,441,i like gruel. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,442,"they don't want to feed us, you ninnies! they want to kill us! all of us! they've got our gold, and they'll do anything to keep it! "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,447,"lies! lies, all of it! murderous thieves, there's no room for their kind in civilised society. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,448,but this is their land! 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,449,"this is my land! i make the laws here. and i say anyone so much as looks at an indian without killing him on sight, will be tried for treason and hanged. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,450,pocahontas!

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,454,he's one of them! 
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,455,you don't know him. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,456,"you go out there, you'll be turning your back on your own people. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,457,i'm trying to help my people. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,nakoma ,1995,458,"pocahontas, please. . . you're my best friend, i don't want you to get hurt. "

MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,461,. . . ratcliffe wouldn't take us halfway around the world for nothing. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,462,but what if smith is right? what if there is no gold? 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,englishman ,1995,463,"if you ask me, ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left london. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ben ,1995,464,"listen to you, you bunch of idiots. those savages didn't attack us for nothing, they're hiding something. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,lon ,1995,465,"if they do have the gold, i reckon we'll have to fight them. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,466,follow him. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,thomas ,1995,467,"yes, governor. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,ratcliffe  ,1995,468,i want to know where he's sneaking off to.

MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,481,maybe it's not too late to stop this. you have to come with me and talk to my father. 
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,482,"pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good. i already tried talking to my men but everything about this land has them spooked. "
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,483,that's the strangest creature i've ever seen!

MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,495,they're not going to listen to us. 
MID,NON-P,Pocahontas ,grandmother willow,1995,496,"man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one. don't you see, only when the fighting stops can you can be together. "
MID,PRINCE,Pocahontas ,john smith,1995,497,"all right, let's go talk to your father. "
MID,PRINCESS,Pocahontas ,pocahontas,1995,498,"kocoum, no! kocoum! leave him alone! "

MID,PRINCESS,Mulan ,mulan,1998,434,i should never have left home. 
MID,NON-P,Mulan ,mushu,1998,435,"hey c'mon. you wanted to save your father's life. who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors and losing all your friends. y'know, you just gotta ... just gotta learn to let these things go. "
MID,PRINCESS,Mulan ,mulan,1998,436,maybe i didn't go for my father. maybe what i really wanted was to prove that i could do things right. so that when i looked in the mirror 
MID,PRINCESS,Mulan ,mulan,1998,437,i'd see someone worthwhile. but i was wrong. i see nothing. 
MID,NON-P,Mulan ,mushu,1998,438,"hey, that's just cause this needs a little spit, that's all. "

LATE,PRINCE,Tangled ,flynn,2010,1,"this is the story of how i died. don't worry, this is actually a very fun story and the truth is, it isn't even mine. this is the story of a girl named rapunzel and it starts with the sun now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens and from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden flower. it had the ability to heal the sick and injured. oh, you see that old woman over there? you might want to remember her. she's kind of important. well, centuries passed, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom. the kingdom was ruled by a beloved king and queen. the sick queen and the queen, well, she was about to have a baby. she got sick. really, sick. she was running out of time, and that's when people usually start to look for a miracle. or in this case, a magic golden flower. ah, i told you she'd be important. you see, instead of sharing the sun's gift, this woman, mothe gothel, hoarded its healng power and used it to keep herself for hundreds of years, and all she had to do was to sing a special song. "

LATE,PRINCE,Tangled ,flynn,2010,5,"the magic of the golden flower healed the queen. a healthy baby girl, a princess was born, with beautiful golden hair. i'll give you a hint, that's rapunzel. "
LATE,PRINCE,Tangled ,flynn,2010,6,"to celebrate her birth, the king and queen launched a flying lantern into the sky. and for that one moment, everything was perfect. and then that moment ended. "
LATE,NON-P,Tangled ,mother gothel,2010,7,"flower, gleam and glow let your power shine make the clock re"
LATE,PRINCE,Tangled ,flynn,2010,8,"gothel broke into the castle, stole the child and just like that gone. the kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the princess. for deep within the forest, in a hidden tower, gothel raised the child as her own. "

LATE,PRINCESS,Tangled ,rapunzel,2010,13,"yes, mommy. "
LATE,PRINCE,Tangled ,flynn,2010,14,"but the walls of that tower could not hide everything. each year, on her birthday, the king and queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky, in hope that one day, their lost princess would return. "

LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,25,"some say our destiny is tied to the land, as much a part of us as we are of it. others say fate is woven together like a cloth, so that one's destiny intertwines with many others. it's the one thing we search for, or fight to change. some never find it. but there are some who are led. the story of how my father lost a leg to the demon bear mor'du became a legend. i became a sister with 3 new brothers, the princes hamish, hubert, and harris. wee devils more like. they get away with murder. i can never get away from anything! "

LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,31,this is all for naught. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,32,i said that! from the jaw. . . 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,33,a princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,34,holding the paper. the paper is like a smaller ‘screenshot' of queen holding paper
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,35,she doesn't make doodles.

LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,50,"merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,51,mum. . . it's just my bow. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,52,a princess should not have weaponry in my opinion. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,king,2012,53,"let her be! princess or not, learning to fight is essential. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,54,"mom, you'll never guess what i did, today! "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,55,hmm? 
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,56,i climbed the crone's tooth and drank from the fire falls. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,king fergus,2012,57,fire falls? they say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,58,"what did you do, dear? "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,59,"nothing, mom. "

LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,62,"you'll get dreadful collywobbles. oh, fergus! will you look at your daughter's plate? "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,63,"fergus, they've all accepted. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,64,"who's accepted what, mother? "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,65,"boys, you are excused. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,66,what did i do now? 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,67,your father has something to discuss with you. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,68,fergus? 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,fergus,2012,69,merida. . . 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,70,the lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,71,what? 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,72,the clans have accepted! 
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,73,dad!

LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,75,"honestly, merida! i don't know why you're acting this way. this year each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,76,i'm the only princess that just does what she's told! 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,77,"a princess does not raise her voice. merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,78,no! what you've been preparing me for my whole life!

LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,84,once there was an ancient kingdom. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,85,aah! mom! ancient kingdom! 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,86,"it's name long forgotten, ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved. and when he grew old he divided the kingdom among his four sons. that they should be the pillars on which their piece of land rested. but the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself, he followed his own path and the kingdom fell, from war and chaos and ruin. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,87,that's a nice story. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,88,"it's not just a story, merida. legends are lessons, and they ring with truths! "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,89,"ach, mom! "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,90,i would advise you to make your peace with this. the clans are coming to present their suitors. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,91,it's not fair! 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,92,"oh, merida! it's marriage, it's not the end of the world. "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,fergus,2012,93,you're muttering. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,94,i don't mutter. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,fergus,2012,95,"aye, you do. you mutter, lass, when something's troubling you. "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,96,i blame you. stubbornness is entirely from your side of the family. 
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,fergus,2012,97,i take it the talk didn't go too well.

LATE,NON-P,Brave ,fergus,2012,105,"i don't want to get married! i want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind as i ride through the glen, firing arrows into the sunset. "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,106,"merida, all this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you, giving you everything we never had, i ask you, what do you expect us to do? "
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,107,"call off the gathering! would that kill them? you're the queen, you can just tell the lords, the princess is not ready for this. in fact, she might not be ever ready for this! so that's that! "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,108,"i understand this must all seem unfair, even i have reservations when i faced betrothal. hey! "
LATE,NON-P,Brave ,queen elinor,2012,109,we can't just run away from who we are. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Brave ,merida,2012,110,i don't want my life to be over. i want my freedom!

LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,311,"the snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. a kingdom of isolation and it looks like i'm the queen. the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. couldn't keep it in, heaven knows i tried. . . don't let them in, don't let them see, be the good girl you always have to be. conceal, don't feel, don't let them know. well, now they know. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,312,let it go. let it go. can't hold it back anymore. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,313,let it go. let it go. turn away and slam the door. i don't care what they're going to say. let the storm rage on. the cold never bothered me anyway. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,314,"it's funny how some distance makes everything seem small. and the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. it's time to see what i can do, to test the limits and break through. no right, no wrong, no rules for me...i'm free! elsa creates ice steps and climbs them. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,315,let it go! let it go! i am one with the wind and sky. let it go! let it go! you'll never see me cry. here i stand and here i'll stay. elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,316,let the storm rage on.... 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,317,my power flurries through the air into the ground. my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around. and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,318,"i'm never going back, "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,319,the past is in the past! 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,320,let it go! let it go! and i'll rise like the break of dawn. let it go! let it go! 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,elsa,2013,321,that perfect girl is gone. here i stand in the light of day. let the storm rage on!! the cold never bothered me anyway. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,322,"elsa! elsa! it's me, anna...your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. i'm sorry. it's all my fffffffault. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,323,"of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret...ha...she's a stinker. a branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. anna goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. she sits up. spits out snow. sees the horse running away. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,324,oh no. no. no. no. come back. no. no. no. no.... ooookay. 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,325,"snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had trtrtropical magic that covered the fffjords in white sand and warm she sees smoke rising up in the distance. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,326,"cold, cold, cold, cold, cold... "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,327,wandering oaken's trading post.

LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,345,"ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. i mean, that is really... "

LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,506,nope. but sometimes i like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come. olaf's fantasy world — perfect summer day 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,507,"bees'll buzz / kids'll blow dandelion fuzz / and i'll be doing whatever snow does in summer. olaf now lies in the sand on a beach. olaf a drink in my hand / my snow up against the burning sand / prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer. olaf sails in a boat. olaf i'll finally see a summer breeze / blow away a winter storm / olaf floats in the water. all his pieces begin to separate. olaf and find out what happens to solid water / when it gets warm. olaf tumbles on a sandy beach with sandsnowmen. olaf and i can't wait to see / what my buddies all think of me / just imagine how much cooler i'll be in summer . . ! olaf and the seagull break out into a tapdance. olaf da da . . . da doo / ah bah bah bah bah bah boo. olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub. olaf the hot and the cold are both so intense / put ‘em together, it just makes sense! olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls. olaf ratdadat dad dada doo . . . olaf bounds down a grassy hill. olaf winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle / but put me in summer and i'll be a... he stops at a puddle, looks down at it. smiles. hops over it. olaf happy snowman! "
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,508,olaf when life gets rough i like to hold on to my dream / of relaxing in the summer sun just letting off steam! 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,509,olaf oh the sky will be blue / and you guys'll be there too / when i finally do what frozen things do in 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,510,i'm gonna tell him.

LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,duke ,2013,523,"prince hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of arendelle's tradable goods? "
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,hans ,2013,524,princess anna has given her orders and 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,duke ,2013,525,and that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all? 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,hans ,2013,526,"do not question the princess. she left me in charge, and i will not hesitate to protect arendelle from treason. "
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,duke ,2013,527,treason?!

LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,538,so you're not at all afraid of her? 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,539,why would i be? 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,540,"yeah. i bet elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever. "

LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,547,you're going to kill yourself. 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,548,kristoff i wouldn't put my foot there.

LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,550,or there. how do you know elsa even wants to see you? 
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,551,i'm just blocking you out cause i gotta concentrate here. 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,552,"you know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone. "
LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,553,nobody wants to be alone. except maybe you 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,554,"i'm not alone.... i have friends, remember? "

LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,559,"...does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her. "
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,560,hang on. 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,561,"hey, sven? not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but i found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go. "

LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,bulda ,2013,769,is it the way that he runs scared? 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kid troll ,2013,770,or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods? 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,771,"no, i don't. "
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,trolls ,2013,772,"his isolation is confirmation of his desperation for healing hugs. so he's a bit of a fixer upper, but we know what to do. the way to fix up this fixer upper is to fix him up with you. "
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,kristoff ,2013,773,enough! she's engaged to someone else. okay?!

LATE,PRINCESS,Frozen ,anna,2013,902,...kristoff loves me? 
LATE,NON-P,Frozen ,olaf ,2013,903,"wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you? "
