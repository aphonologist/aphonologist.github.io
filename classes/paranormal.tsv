Apperently I babysat more then one kid	When I was 13, I babysat a little girl named Emma one of the sweetest kids you could think of. I was a regular babysitter for her so much so that when I couldn't babysit for a few months, she called all her other babysitters by my name.  This happened after I came back to be a regular babysitter for her. It was about 1030 at night, I had already put Emma to bed and had been channel surfing.  The house was Sen up that the front half was open concept the living room, dining room and kitchen were side by side in between the living room and dining room was an open doorway to the back half of the house, at one end was Emma's room the other end has her parents with the bathroom connected to the parents room.  Now while sitting on the couch, I heard something run down the hall to the bathroom. Assuming it was just Emma going to the bathroom I let be a few minutes went by and I heard the feet heading back down the hall, I turned to tell her to go back an make sure she flushed as I hadn't heard it but I only saw the tips of black hair that had ran passed the open doorway.  Here's the problem, Emma is Blonde.  I quickly jumped up and rushed to Emma's bedroom throwing open the door, her nightlight bright enough to make her out as she sat up and looked at me rubbing her eyes in confusion. I asked her if she had went to the bathroom, when she shook her head I did a once over of her room, checking under her bed and a quick peek in her closet. I didn't see anything and I just told Emma I was double checking for monsters.  I tucked Emma back in saying goodnight as I headed out of her room again leaving it slightly open I began to walk away but stopped when I hear Emma speak thinking she was going to ask me something I turn to listen only to hear.  "You should have said something, don't scare her, I really like her."  I didn't say anything to the mom about and continue to babysit Emma until the moved away, I always made an effort after that to "include" the being. If Emma was drawing an extra spot was set up. It seem to make Emma happy and nothing ever startled me again.
A friend said goodbye to me in my dream right before I found out he died	A quick backstory: When I was about twelve years old, I met a boy, who was only two years younger than me. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with a fatal and incurable disease known as Batten disease. I knew that he needed a friend so I stayed by his side as he faced sudden blindness and paralysis. As often as I could, I would go over and help out around the house, read to him, and watch movies.  I remember one night I grew very tired and quickly dozed off. My dream started with me walking to his house as usual, and then I suddenly saw him running towards me with a smile on his face. I was stunned in the dream, looking at him with pure confusion. He came up to me and started talking as I stood there frozen.  "So this is what you look like. I want you to know that you were my only friend and I don't want you to worry. I'm not in pain anymore."  The dream ended with him walking away as I woke up. I laid there processing the dream and an hour or so later, my mom came into my room, crying as she delivered the news. He passed away. Even though it was very sad, the dream made me feel at peace.  Does anyone else have a similar experience?
Butterflies won’t leave me alone now that my older brother has passed away, we used to raise and make pets out of butterflies together.	My brother and I were best friends growing up. He was 4 years older than me, he was my biggest role model.  As a young boy, probably close to being 10 years old, he was absolutely fascinated by butterflies. He took care of them, loved raising them from cocoons, he knew everything about every butterfly. After they would pass away he would keep them because he thought they were beautiful, and loved them dearly. I partook in it merely because I admired my older brother so much and wanted to do everything he did, because I thought he was the best. The butterflies never seemed to care for me much, they’d land on him like crazy but wouldn’t land on me — even when we would go to places like “butterfly world” where they’re used to humans, they would land on everyone except me.  As he progressed into adulthood he struggled with addiction, which ended up making him fall very ill and his body gave up on him - he had a heart attack the last time he used a substance, and he passed away. He still loved butterflies up until then, when he was 23.  Although we weren’t close at this chapter in our lives, as his addiction had really pushed me away — we still talked occasionally when he was going through his good days. The last time I saw him, a few weeks before he died, we were visiting our mom and had brought up ghosts. As we had both always thought her house was haunted. Growing up him and I had many paranormal experiences, which we both saw together and talked about the last day I saw him, they were experiences that made us bond even more since no one else saw these things but us, together. While still being very young, we had moved into a rental for the month, we would play in the attic. We had been in there lots at this point, but one day went up there and it was filled with probably 10 monarch butterflies which we assumed came in through the slightly opened window, we both saw it and were in awe, played with them for a while; but by the next day they were gone. I don’t remember us ever even telling our parents. It wasn’t until I was much older and realized that was very strange. — The visit I had with him before we passed, the topic of paranormal got shifted into reincarnation. He asked if humans could reincarnate into anything, like a butterfly, he wondered. It was a very brief moment, but now that he has passed some strange things have been happening to me and I can’t get the few seconds out of my brain where he mentioned reincarnating into a butterfly.  He passed away in late January, it was still basically winter where we live. Not soon after this, a bright orange butterfly was outside of my house. I thought it was so strange, and it of course didn’t make it due to the cold. I didn’t really give it a second thought, other than how weird it was that there was a butterfly in February. Ever since then butterflies follow me everywhere, it’s gotten to the point where it’s very strange and even the people around me think it’s strange. We are not in a very butterfly-populated place, but they land on my head randomly as I’m walking to work now. They land on my leg when I’m not looking, as I’m sunbathing, and scare the living hell out of me. We went floating down a river in a different town, and halfway down the 3 hour river ride a butterfly landed on my arm rested on the tube. The group of 15 we were with saw it and thought it was so bizarre, none of them could get it to come near them. This morning I got home from work and a very bright, new-looking butterfly was seated on my front step, seemingly unable to fly. It looks completely uninjured but wouldn’t leave, so I fed it and gave it a nice sunny place to rest and it’s still sat outside the door hours later, fluttering around but won’t fly away.  I can’t help but feel somehow my brother is doing this which is a lovely thought, but it makes me filled with so much sadness and grief wishing I could tell him about all these butterflies.
Anyone else ever have dreams of a future event that you dont remember until said event happens?	It happens too many times for me. It’s like a Deja Vu moment, except I know what i’m going to say or exactly what someone else is going to say. It’s like i lived the moment before (Like deja vu) but I KNOW what happens. Please tell me that other people have this and that i’m not a freak.  
Something my daughter told me terrifies me... 	This past year my family went on a sabbatical in another country. My daughter (4) talks a lot about returning to our old house and something she said recently gave me chills.  Daughter: “When we go back, can I sleep in Mommy’s room”  Me: (no backbone) “Yes, sometimes we can have sleepovers. But don’t you remember, you have a huge bed to sleep in in your room. All your toys are in there.... your stuffed animals....”  Daughter: “But that guy, remember, I wake up at night because he’s there with me.”  Me: (mentally freaking out) “What? No I don’t remember. What man?”  Daughter: “He sits in the corner. He’s all black, he doesn’t talk he just sits by me.”  Me: “what, what does his face look like?”  Daughter: “He has no eyes, but I think he has a mouth.”  Me: (in shock) “Well..... you can definitely sleep in my room....”  What the fuck is that. Also how is she so nonchalant about some terrifying thing in her room like this.
I finally messaged my landlord asking about the ghost. He’d never had tenants talk about hauntings, I go on, telling him about Francis(the name I made up for my ghost roommate). He stops me mid-sentence BECAUSE FRANCIS USED TO OWN THE HOUSE AND LIVED HERE DECADES AGO	Backstory/list of paranormal events:  Months back on a Sunday I was having a nightmare where I was yelling for someone to leave and they wouldn’t. Wake up to see this cloud of mist at the foot of my bed and it just glides out of the room. Whole time I’m watching I’m just like “oh cool it’s leaving” then it dawned on me what I saw and got spooked. But obvs there are a dozen ways to argue that didn’t happen. So although I know what I saw I was like eh not worth it.  My thermostat is in my living room. I KNOW the consistent temp of my apartment. Even through the night because I do a decent amount of all-nighters. Big thing with ghosts is they have a cold presence. On Sundays I’ll always wake up sweating buckets with the furnace running constantly as though the thermostat is measuring the house as really cold. But this only happens on Sunday nights.  A while back my friend is over and I just addressed the ghost being like “hey let’s set some ground rules, what’s your name? Francis? Imma call you Francis. I don’t mind you but you can’t be messin with me ruining my sleep schedule”. The random intense furnace stuff stops, but still, someone could say it was all in my head, selective stuff or some logical debunking.  I will casually talk to Francis just when I get home from work “hey Francis I’m home!” Or whatever. Kinda funny  Sunday, before the start of my 3 day overnight shifts I go “yo Francis I’m gonna be doing overnights the next three nights so you got the place to yourself. No parties tho”.  Tuesday night, my same friend is over and I’m running late for work by at least a half hour. Clearly Francis is kinda salty cuz I’m not giving him the space I told him. My friend can’t find their socks anywhere while I’m getting ready for work. Get this; I go to the bathroom to brush my teeth and their socks ARE UP ON THE SHELF IN MY BATHROOM. I’m like wtf Francis moved your socks. There is no way in hell those socks were there before. I was in the bathroom earlier that night and they were not there and my friend never went to the bathroom the whole time they were over. That’s the most unexplainable experience of it all.  When I am leaving my driveway, my car always shines its light through the back door window all the way to the door of my downstairs neighbor’s. I’m nosy so I always peer through. That night I didn’t but my friend did and jumps in their seat swearing they saw a pale old man staring at them through the window. I didn’t see it, so it still could be brain playing tricks along with a trick of the light although I’ve never had a weird glare or reflection any time I look through that window.  So the next morning I have the convo that’s described in the post title.  Also I would always shrug off the constant times I’d wake up from a nap or go to one of my doors and see it was unlocked. I’m a forgetful person and didn’t grow up locking doors. I’ll often even be like “oh yea I recall forgetting to lock it when I came home” but sometimes I don’t recall forgetting to lock it and now I’m thinking that’s cuz Francis will be opening that shit when he’s moving around the house.  That’s all :)  Edit: just to clarify, my apartment is half of the 2nd floor of an old house that was built in the 1860s it still has the original frame and actually the front door is the original door. So it’s not like an apartment complex it’s just an old Victorian style house in a small city in upstate New York  Edit 2: also I just want to say I love all these other similar experiences people are sharing. It definitely eases my mind. Hope everyone has very happy holidays
My son knows things he shouldn't. 	This is my first time posting here, so hang with me. I have 4 sons, My oldest is 6 and he's the one I'm curious about. Since he was very young, first learning to talk, he's occasionally said things that don't make any sense for him to know. We were on vacation with my inlaws at the beach when he was 2.5 and he had a blast in the water with my husband and I. The next day, we got up bright and early to go back and he adamantly refused. He kept insisting that there were alligators in the water. We tried to reason with him thatalligatorsdidn'tlive in saltwater, but he wasn't having it. Well, my husband had taken one of our twins, almost a year old, into the water and they were playing. A few moments later, a man comes running from the peir yelling at him to get out of the water and for us to get away from the water. He explained that while watching the water from the peir, he saw an alligator just underneath the water, stalking my husband from a distance. He called 911 and animal control arrived and were eventually able to locate and capture the alligator. It was 8ft long. There had been storms during the night and it was mating season. The explanation was that he was looking for a mate and had come in through a freshwater river that runs into the sea. But, how could my son have known about that hours before it happened? Another time, I was going outside to do yard work and he told me not to go near the bushy tree, fig tree, because there was a rattle snake under it. I thought it was just childhood imagination. I'm doing the yard work and I go over to that tree to see if any figs are ripe and I heard the rattle. I looked down and I was about 3ft away from a rattle snake and it wasn't happy to see me. I quickly got away as not to disturb it further and hope it would go on its way. He shouldn't have known it was there. Another time, we were going to go visit my mom and he was asleep. We hadn't told him where we were going because she had a surprise for him. We got in the car and he said, you can't go this way to Grandma's because the bridge is out. We always went that way if my husband was driving and the bridge had been fully operational the day before. Sure enough, we get to the bridge and its tapped off with a detour sign. There's no way he should have known because word hadn't gotten out yet, especially since my cousin is the local supervisor and he didn't tell anyone about it until after I called him.I honestly find this all a little creepy because I can't logically explain it.  
Trees I planted 18 years ago felt “happy” to see me last time I went and visited them 	So when I was about 5 years old I planted about 500-600 pine trees on some land our family owns with my grandpa.  Grandpa died a couple years later and no one ever went back until recently when I decided I wanted to go camp w some friends.  As soon as I got there I was amazed at how tall they were, at least 30-40 feet and I just couldn’t shake the feeling the whole little forest I planted was happy to see me.  The whole time I was there it felt insanely positive and I just kept getting the happy vibes from the trees.  What do y’all think some explanations could be? I was thinking maybe either nature spirits or residual energy mixed w my own emotions , lemme know what you think!
Got lost in the woods for 8+ hours as a little girl, and saw something unexplainable	I grew up in a densely forested rural area in central Virginia, and like most kids my age (10, at the time of this story) I spent a lot of time playing in and around the woods. My best friend and I had found a creek one day while exploring different deer trails through the woods.  This creek we happened on was a very rare find and the perfect spot for us to play. It was wide and deep enough to swim around in and had nice, soft mossy banks on either side to rest on after we had tired ourselves out. The water was cool and clear, no copperheads, and no mosquitoes because the water was constantly running. We were psyched. After a few hours of swimming we had to walk back home for lunch, but made plans to pack lunch the next day so we could have a picnic on the creek banks and spend the whole day there.  The next morning we set out for the woods at around 1pm, planning to have the picnic first and swim after. We entered at the same spot we had the previous day and followed what we thought was the same deer trail. It was not. At the point where we should have found the creek, we walked into a small clearing that was covered in huge, thick ferns. We had definitely never walked past this before. So, being both hungry and tired of walking, we decided to eat in the clearing. We laughed and played around there for a while, spitting watermelon seeds at each other from our lunch. It was an absolute blast and we were both in wonderful, giddy moods. That all changed, however, as soon as we packed up and set back out to find the creek.  As we walked on the woods started to feel darker and colder, we got skiddish and I noticed my friend kept whipping her head around to look behind us. After about a half hour of walking we came up on what looked like an entire overgrown bathroom. Sink, toilet, and bathtub all sitting arranged together and covered in ivy. It’s pretty common to find weird shit like this in the middle of the woods, so we just walked on and made jokes to lighten the mood, calling it Bigfoot’s Bathroom.  After another hour of walking and not seeing anything we recognized, we started to panic. Instead of trying to reach the creek we were now just trying to find our way back home or out of the woods, at least. I told her we should follow the sun and eventually we would come up on a road or someone’s property where we could find help. She insisted on another way and we began yelling at each other out of fear and, lets be honest, little girl bossiness. I told her if she thought she was so right she should just go her way and we would see who got out first, so we split up. Now as an adult I fully acknowledge I was being a stubborn brat, and also, an idiot. Worst possible thing we could have done.  Not ten minutes after splitting up I began to hear someone walking maybe 100ft behind me. Thinking it was my friend deciding to go my way after all, I slow down so she can catch up to me. Instead, whatever it was matched my pace. I slow down, it slows down. I stop, it stops. This went on for hours. The whole time I was going back and forth on whether or not it was in my head or there was really something following me. I picked up a big stick, swung it a few times to make sure it was sturdy if I had to hit someone, and trucked on.  As it began to get dark, I came up on something that made my heart sink into my stomach. It was Bigfoot’s Bathroom. I had just walked in a huge circle, for hours, despite being 100% sure I was following the setting sun West the entire time. Confused and frustrated, I sat down on a log and just screamed my little heart out while smacking my whoopass stick repeatedly into the ground. As I tried to collect myself, I heard the footsteps again walking up on me from behind. I called out my friends name as loud as I could. No answer. Then, after a short pause, the steps began to run towards me. I jumped up and booked it fast as I could in the opposite direction.  Now, this is the truly horrifying part which I typically omit while telling people this story. As I was sprinting through the darkening woods, I began to hear what I thought were church bells. I looked up to see the darkest, deepest cloud I have even seen in my life. In the middle it was so black it was like looking into the night sky, and the dark grey around it seemed to be swirling. It gave me a horrible feeling to look at, almost like the nausea you get when looking through binoculars too long. What sickened me further is that I realized the sound of the bells was coming through the hole in the cloud. They were deafeningly loud, I mean really booming out of this thing. When I realized this I stopped dead in my tracks. I felt a sense of absolute and overwhelming dread that has gone unmatched in all my 24 years on this planet. Something in my head began screaming that if I did not run away from whatever the hell that cloud was no one would ever see me again, I would be gone. I did not want to run toward the thing chasing behind me either though, so I made a sharp right and took off away from both.  It was now completely dark and I was running blind through the woods, smacking through branches, wheezing, and tripping every few feet for what seemed like another hour. Until I smacked into something low and flew over it, hitting the ground so hard all the air in my lungs was knocked out of me. As I lay there trying to recover, I realized I couldn’t hear the bells anymore. Then my eyes adjusted more to the dark, and I realized what had just made me go ass-over-teeth was an old fence. Grabbing hold of it I prayed it would lead me to a farm, and sure enough it did. I walked up over a hill about a mile to the back of the farm house, explained what had happened, and the farmer graciously gave me a ride back home.  I was covered head to toe in scrapes, oozing blood, and more exhausted than I had ever been in my life, but I was finally safe. It was passed 9pm when I finally walked through my front door. My friend had gotten back shortly after we split and figured I had as well, so hadn’t told anybody I was lost, and my family just figured I was still out after dark, which wasn’t uncommon for me. They were shocked when I walked in beat up and crying. Nobody had been looking for me at all. To this day I wonder how long they would’ve waited to come find me if I hadn’t been lucky enough to find the fence, and if it would’ve been too late.
Our family dog came back to visit my mom. Picture in link.	So Koda, the best golden retriever that ever lived died years ago. When my dad set up a trail cam to spy on a fox, he got this picture of what looks like Koda visitng my mom. My mom was her person.  Koda appears to be on the deck on the left side of the picture. On the right aide, my mom is bent over leaning half way out the open door to the sun room. If something was on the deck, she would have seen it two feet from her face. At this point the whole family is convinced it is a picture of ghost Koda.
I died once. Here is my experience. 	(I suffered a massive stroke so I apologize for any spelling, grammar and format errors I make. )  In 2012 I had suffered a stroke that killed me. As I slipped away I had felt an overwhelming peace come over me like I had never felt before. Things went black, then I was ascending above and I saw the city below. Next to me I heard a voice from this orb of varied colored lights that also had a mist coming off of it. It was a woman’s voice and she was telling me how excited she was to finally be with her family and see her Mom and Dad again. I started to feel unsure and told her I wasn’t suppose to be here.  Suddenly I was standing in a otherworldly place that was gorgeous. All the structures and buildings were made of what looked similar to marble but it had an iridescent color between the marbling. The buildings were decorated with colorful stones with gold embezzlement’s lining the buildings and glass fencing.  I walked along the path with my arms crossed and holding to my body. I felt lost and everyone around me was chattering happily with each other in these otherworldly clothes of satin like linens. Some people held hands and were close and joyful with each other. This place was absolutely beautiful.  I came upon a old man who was sitting near a tree and what seemed to be teaching a class with people surrounding him. Some were sitting and others were standing. He called me over to join him. He was teaching the lessons of what life is suppose to be on earth, what it was originally suppose to be and how humans were suppose to be carrying for the world and the inhabitants on it but materialism had gotten in the way among other things. I felt an overwhelming knowledge come over me as he continued to teach this class about the world, the universe, life and death. Everyone began to surround me and the old man put his hand on my shoulder and he said, “It’s not your time yet. You will know when it is.” The people from the class all came in and held me in a circle and I was suddenly back.  I opened my eyes and breathed in. I was alive and back in my earthly body. This is how I came to believe in God, and also reincarnation. I don’t claim a religion because my beliefs are now a mix of things. Unfortunately, slowly that knowledge that was instilled into me slowly slipped away over the years, but I feel it in the back of my mind. To me, religion became several fingers pointing to the same being. I don’t need a religion to dictate my relationship with God.  If you’re all wondering, I am 27 now and suffer residual effects that have disabled me but I keep going. My body may not work properly, but my brain still does and I focus on expanding my knowledge in various areas.
I volunteered after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and there was something there that still scares me to this day 	Okay, here it goes. I have a medical background and a certification I rarely use though I keep going back and paying to renew it. Anyhow, I volunteered almost immediately thinking I would help those who have lived through Katrina. That was not the case. There were a few of us who are assigned once the water started to recede, to find houses that had dead bodies in them.  If you've ever had to do a body recovery when it has been lying around in the heat and the water for days, sometimes weeks at a time, you know how it smells. It does sort of smell like any other dead carcass but worse. I can't explain it, maybe somehow, sweeter smelling. Anyway, the key to not vomiting when you smell them is Vix in under and around the bottom of your nose. It doesn't keep all the smell out but enough until you can at least tolerate the smell without vomiting.  We had to go to each house and go inside in wading boots and look for bodies. Many of them washed out to sea but some were still in the houses they had lived in prior to the hurricane. If we found a body, we spray painted a big X on the outside of the house. This other guy and I had been doing it for a while and we got assigned each other almost every day. We got along okay and he didn't vomit at the ones that had been "gotten to."  We came up to this one old shack, I say shack because it was pretty run down and in what had been a very bad neighborhood. Right away, I got chills down my spine. I knew there was something really wrong. Not like find a body kind of wrong, but chilling kind of wrong. New Orleans has certain areas that just give off these vibes and my understanding is there is a lot of voodoo practiced in certain areas.  Anyway, against everything my body was screaming at me, we went in the house. The first thing I could smell was a body, the second was something almost earthy and mold. I looked at my partner, (I will call him Jay). He was white as a sheet. I could tell he was getting that same feeling I had been getting. It was obvious from the weird bones hanging from the ceiling, (I would bet money they were cats), something odd had been going down in the house as well as strange beads and carvings in the bare wood in the walls.  We went into what was a kitchen and there chained to a beam was an old lady or what was left of her. She had chained herself by her wrists to the beam, her guts were falling out on the floor. The creepiest thing was her face still looked as though she were alive and staring at us with a wicked smile showing only partial teeth. (They were nubs). My skin started crawling as the goosebumps spread over my body and my neck hair stood up.  Suddenly, I heard the most unearthly cackling noise I have ever heard in my life and my flight or fight kicked in. Jay and I noped out of there. We quickly painted the X and literally ran to the next house.  Now I don't know if that old lady had practiced voodoo or whatever, but that scared the everliving shit out of me. It still gives me nightmares. The people I feel sorry for are the ones who had to take that crazy lady out of there.  Jay and I discussed it that night after we went back to the hotels north of there. He had heard the cackling too but we both said it had to be the wind or something.
My experiences as a crime scene cleaner 	To start out, you need a little back story to show how i got into this situation...  When i got out of high school around 2003, finding a job was difficult so i took whatever horrible jobs i could to get by. when i found a job cleaning fire and water damage full time, i was excited to have steady income and start saving, but this quickly turned into a nightmare that i had to endure for almost 2 years. the company i worked for put me on my first job which was a water damage claim where a basement flooded with sewage, so after a few days of work we finished and it was on to the next job.  my boss then called me into his office the next morning and told me about a special crew that he was setting up and asked if i would be the crew leader supervising 3 other guys that were just hired. i found this strange as i had only been working there a total of around 3 days, but figured my work ethic was already paying off and i would get a raise, i only made 10 a hour to start. not only did i not get the raise, but i got no training in the new position other than a work van with cleaning material, and the phone numbers for the 3 new guys that also were hired in to do fire/water damage cleanup.  The boss told me what tools were best to use and what cleaning products to use to sanitize along with where everything was located in the van, with hazmat suits and respirators, but he was vague about what kind of things i would clean up, he just said the situations were always different and i would get detailed instructions each job. he called my position CSC crew leader... the boss told me that i would never have to see the deceased as the coroner would have the remains gone by the time my crew got there, and to use my logic to determine what needed to be removed from the homes and what could be cleaned.    The first job i had in my new position which the boss told me about when i got to the office was cleaning up the remains of a elderly man or woman who died in their house and had been laying in chair. when we arrived, the coroner had me come inside to show me a few things that were considered hazardous material and needed to be removed due to the risk of disease, i guess my boss knew a few people from the county coroners office and much of the work came from their recommendations.  not only was the deceased still in the house, but was fully visible to me and the other guy and you could smell the rot through the masks as the house had no AC and this was mid June. the coroner was backed up and waiting on additional people to show up to load the body as it was falling apart, and i call the body it because i honestly couldn't tell if it was male or female and was trying not to look too long as it was disturbing.  the other 3 guys i worked with handled it well but 2 got sick from the smell and has to go outside to puke. we all waited outside after the coroner showed us the chair, the fluids that leaked into the carpet, and the basement where the fluids went through the sub floor and puddled on some boxes in the basement. the coroners support arrived and took the deceased out and me and the crew started working. after about 5 minutes weird things started to happen, the first of which was when i began to disassemble the chair.  i had removed the back of the chair and was putting it into the special hazmat bags that i was given and the base started to rock when i was about 10 feet away putting the bag with the back of the chair by the front door. nobody else was in the same room as the other guys were in the basement dealing with moving boxes. i brushed it off and took apart the base of the chair as much as i could and when i got it into the bag i got a chill up my back and then began feeling sick, i just figured it was the shock of what i was cleaning hitting me and pushed on, even though the chill was strange as i was very hot in full hazmat in June.  next was removing the carpet and assessing the floor to see if it would be able to be cleaned or if i had to remove a section of the floor, so i called the boss to ask him and he told me just to pour the special cleaner on the area to soak into the floor boards and it would be fine, so i got it out of the truck where he said it was and brought it inside. when i got inside all 3 of the guys in the basement were scrambling to get out of the basement, tripping over each other, and all 3 ran outside. when i asked them what was up all 3 said there was someone in the cluttered basement and they assumed it was a homeless person or junky, Detroit has many issues with these kinds of things.  i listened at one of the open windows to the basement, its kind of the first thing we did when we started working, open any window possible, prop the doors open, so maybe someone got inside then or possibly before we got there and was hiding. after listening a few minutes and hearing nothing, me and another of the workers went inside, armed with a mag light and a piece of metal fence post and searched the basement. nothing was down there but the footprints of the shoe covers we used, but when we started up the stairs, we heard a horrible hacking cough from somewhere in the basement. when we looked for it, there was nothing, but the corner of the basement had a bunch of dust stirred up like someone was moving things very recently that weirded us both out.  we called the guys back in and they got back to the boxes, but all of them kept feeling like they were being touched while throwing away material from the boxes that got fluids on them. i went back to my upstairs job but found that the cleaner i put next to the floor boards was gone, and i started getting frustrated as it was the only jug i had of this cleaner and i clearly remember it being set next to the area before the guys ran up the stairs and my attention was redirected.  i began to take out trash figuring i would find it eventually or the basement guys took it for the floor, and i found it on its side, behind the bag that had the back of the chair.  this is impossible, there were like 6 other bags in front of this one near the front door, and this was a gallon bottle of cleaner, again i got a chill but this one was brought on by what sounded like a whisper that i could not make out the words to. cleaned the floor boards and moved out trash, job complete. that night each member of my crew had a dream about a older man telling us that we are not welcome in his home, touching his belongings and we need to leave.  in my dream i was alone in his house, the old man cried and told me i was destroying his things and he couldn't replace anything. he was trying to push me out of his house, but it was like i was ignoring him, even when he would push me and scream at me, no reaction from me. he then threw my cleaner into the garbage pile i had made by the front door, exactly where i found it. 2 of the 3 guys in the crew told me their dreams about the old man pushing them as they went through boxes of ruined pictures and other old stuff that needed to be thrown out due to the risk of disease from his fluids.  they also said it was like they had no control and were on autopilot, they said they were so sad but couldn't do anything. the thing that got me about the dreams of the other 2 guys, was they both said the man was getting so upset that he began violently coughing, and that the man kept grabbing their arms when they would touch boxes or throw things into the trash.  neither of the guys were in the house when me and the other guy heard the coughing from the basement. the guy that went into the basement with me said he had a dream but all he remembered was waking up sad like he did something wrong, and had a horrible coughing fit, which might just be a coincidence, but i connected it in my mind as relating to the other dreams.  we all talked about it and came to the conclusion that we were all just having a reaction to a situation and it was nothing more than our brains coping with what we had to do. im very into psychology so i rationalized it the best i could and we hoped for better assignments the next day.  next few jobs were not so bad, cleaning up blood at a home invasion, no casualty, but huge mess, then there was a few other bloody crime scenes with casualties but nothing notable happened. About a 2 weeks into the job we began to learn the tricks of the trade and were split into 2 different groups that i was responsible to manage as crew leader, so i would have to go to different sites if the other 2 guys had an issue or didnt know what to do. i thought i was getting used to the job as well as the other guys as we had no other experiences like the first job, but i was wrong...  the next job that there was activity was a suicide of a man that was middle aged, the coroner had already removed the body, but it was a mess. the guy had shot himself with what i think was a large caliber handgun or shotgun, as the spray was everywhere in the basement in like a second living room. there were skull fragments lodged in drywall, brain matter all over, and again he was not found for a bit so the smell was horrible.  first step in cleaning this was using our backpack vacuum cleaner to suck up all the bio material. the coroner told us when we went in that he and his partner were extremely uneasy in the house and it felt strange and we immediately started getting a claustrophobic suffocating feeling when we went into the basement as well.  to make matters worse, the family of the man had came over and were crying upstairs, but the vacuum noise helped to cancel out that. while i was cleaning, the power to the lights went out and it was completely pitch black. this was strange because my vacuum was still powered. my crew mate started screaming at this point so i turned off my vacuum and climbed off my ladder, i thought maybe he touched a wire to the lights but when my vacuum unit was turned off he was still screaming and i could hear things being knocked over.  i started fumbling around for my flashlight on my tool belt and yelled for my friend asking what was going on but all i got back was panicked screaming, then i saw in the pitch black, something darker that was moving in my direction and i will admit, i freaked out. i slipped trying to backup still looking in my belt for the flashlight and found it when my back hit the basement wall, i turned on the light aimed at the blackest shape i have ever seen and when the light turned on, i saw the shape of a man wearing a flannel shirt, beard, and an expression like he was about to attack me, then it was just gone.  my crew mate was behind where the entity was, sitting on the floor rocking with his hands on his head, when i approached, he picked up his flashlight off the ground and turned it on, then ran up the stairs and outside and threw up.  i followed behind him, asking if he was OK and why he was screaming, i thought i just imagined the entity and the man because his screaming scared me, but he told me that he was scrubbing the wall and felt something pulling on something in his tool belt and he thought it was me, but when he turned around, the lights went out and he was engulfed by what he said was like dark smoke and he immediately could not breathe and was struggling to move.  he managed to pull his flashlight out but it was knocked out of his hand like his wrist was grabbed with force and he managed to scream. when he screamed, trinkets started falling off a entertainment center that was about 3 feet to his side and the black smoke moved back, but he was close to passing out from exertion.  he also said he lost hearing and didn't know that any noise came out when he started screaming and that the stuff falling off the shelves was landing on him and that's why he was covering his head. he said it felt like a weight was lifted off him when the dark smoke backed up but he felt sick right away, and the light from my flashlight made the sick feeling increase.  we took an early lunch where he just sat there, pale as ever and didn't say much other than he said he breathed in that smoke and didn't feel right. i got him some gator aid and his color started to come back, i never told him i saw a man when i turned on my light because we still needed to finish and i didn't want to put that in his head since he never mentioned seeing it.  when we went back, the lights in the basement were on again, half the things that fell from the shelves were back on the entertainment center, and the TV was on baseball, there was also a different smell in the room, similar to burnt hair. my worker, stayed a half hour, got sick again and went home for the day, leaving me alone to finish, which i didn't want to do but had to as the other guys had their own job.  after cleaning up everything with my vacuum, i began scrubbing the old blood, which is hard after it congeals, mix in brain matter and it is like glue, even with cleaner. while i was finishing up i kept seeing the shape of a person always in the side of my vision, each time i would smell that strange burnt hair scent and a few times, i also felt like a force was pulling at items on my belt, not sure what item as there were several things in my belt.  when i finished the job, i went to use the bathroom upstairs, and in the hallway along the way i heard like muffled crying or moaning, i froze up and stayed still thinking maybe a family member had came back and when i panned around, there was nothing, but i saw a picture on the wall of a man with a beard wearing a flannel, several other pictures in the hallway of other scenarios of the same man, different flannels with deer or fish or family. i had not seen a picture of that man as i had not been anywhere else in the house with a bathroom, nor did i use the bathroom downstairs because pulling off the hazmat stuff is a pain.  as i was securing the house, closing all windows, locking doors and shutting down every light but the front porch light, i saw the front curtain move and again saw the darker than black form in the front window.  the last experience i will share in this thread happened mid July in a very bad area in Detroit. there had been a incident where a guy supposedly tried to abduct a child, was stopped by people in the neighborhood who beat the man very bad and he escaped to his house where the neighborhood people quickly called police and civilians surrounded the mans house to prevent escape.  the police response time in this area is horrible and the people were throwing rocks through the mans window and damaged his car. the man was hurt bad by the mob and was hurt by a rock or glass and died in the home (this is assumption by dpd) from what the police officer told me, it was a misunderstanding and the man picked up a girl that was injured riding her bike and some kids that knew her told their parents that the man was kidnapping her and people over reacted and the man was brutally beaten.  the cleanup was pretty simple to do, we secured windows, cleaned up blood and bodily fluid, but as soon as i entered the house, i just felt wave after wave of fear and sadness, like i have never felt this before and it hit in waves that made my legs weak. my working buddy who was there showed up late and didn't get the story from the cop like i did, but experienced the same feelings i had. the whole time we were there, we saw a form darting around corners, like it was watching us, then hiding, it was similar to like a small bit of fog or mist.  we also heard very slight cries for help coming from several areas in the house and also what sounded like "please stop" and long "noooooo" a few times the crowd came back and yelled at the house also, and when this was going on the activity in the house increased and we could hear running footsteps go up the stairs, a door slam, and it sounded like the front door would open and close but we never saw any of the doors move.  the path of the footsteps sounded like from the front door,through living room, to the bathroom, to stairs to the upstairs bungalow room. the part that really got me, was i could feel the floor impacts that felt like the vibrations of someone running past me when i was cleaning the areas. and each time i would be hit by one of those waves of fear and sadness.  when we left the house there were a few people on porches hanging out like is usual during summer and the people were still hostile and yelling random things, but directed at us as we loaded the van and took off hazmat suits. we ignored this, but before we had loaded all the material from the house into the van and locked the house, the front door slammed hard enough to sound like a gunshot, which scared me and my crew member, along with the people on the front porch to the point where they went inside. the front door deadbolt was somehow locked and we could not get it open, i think it was a different key than the knob, so we ended up leaving several boards in the house that were left over from boarding a few of the windows.  the feeling of relief when i left the house was like night and day, inside i was, anxious, scared, paranoid, and just really down, which could be due to knowing the story, but when i got outside, it was like flipping a light switch, i immediately felt better and me and the other guy in my crew were joking and laughing about dumb stuff and normal 19 and 20 year old shenanigans.  i have many of these stories written down in detail in a journal i started after the first 3 months of working at this job. i talked to the guys on the crews and got other strange stories from them too. i know that some of this could very well be formed by my subconscious mind to cope with traumatic situations, but some of it has no explanation and when i hear other members of my crew tell me their stories when they haven't been influenced by mine, that is a horse of a different color...  when i have time, i will pull out the journal and give more of my experiences, the job got way worse when i started the journal after 3 months in, several experiences with what i think was paranormal, many situations that stressed my mental state to the point where my mask of sanity started to slip. in the end i worked at this place for almost 2 years, and of my crew, all died, 2 from suicides, one from drug overdose that could have been intentional but we will never know.  i just know that when these 3 guys, my age, around 19 and 20, started this job, all were normal well adjusted guys with no cares in the world other than girls, parties, and working. i watched each one of them slowly drain their joys and passion for life, and i know this sounds bad, but each one that died was considerate enough to die in a clean way, most likely so another person wouldn't have to see the horrible thing that we all saw so often...
My mom saw “La Llorona” in Mexico when she was 15. 	Alright so this story has been told to me by my mom a few times. And every single time I still get that creepy eerie feeling that someone is watching me. My mom is from a small town in Mexico located in Zacatecas. When she was around 14, she had the habit of waking her mom up to go to the restroom since it was an older home and the restroom was located outside. My mom tells me that it was around 3 AM when she woke up and felt the need to use the restroom urgently. So she began calling out for her mom, after a while of her mom not responding she began getting agitated and started screaming. At this point my mom turns around and at the foot of her bed she sees her mom standing there. She was wearing a white robe but had a very bleak expression on her face & both of her arms were extended. My mom said that she suddenly felt extremely cold and a huge sense of dread. She had never seen her mom wear a white robe.. that’s when she looked down and saw her “mom’s” feet weren’t touching the floor. At that moment she screamed and quickly threw the covers over her head. Her mom wearing something completely different runs in to find my mom shaking in her bed. Nobody believed my mom, everyone told her it was a dream. Until a few days later there was a power outage, during this my mom and a few of her siblings with her parents all decided to sleep in the living room. At around the same time @ 3 AM, they heard the same undeniable wails of la llorona down their street. None of them slept that night.  
A middle of the night wrong number phone call may have saved my daughter's life. Guardian angel?	I realize this could be one hell of a coincidence but it is rare to get a phone call at 3am, especially a wrong number.  My daughter was a newborn and I was a sleep deprived mom. The phone rang at 3am and woke up my husband and I. He got up to answer it and as he left the room I felt something under me. I was laying across my baby. I must have taken her to bed to feed and fell asleep.  It is exactly what parents are warned about and I feel awful, awful that I made this mistake.  My daughter was fine, I must have only just rolled onto her, and my husband returned to the bedroom saying it was someone speaking in a language he did not understand.  We were very shaken up and I took precautions to ensure it never happened again.  My daughter is 18 and likes to think she has a guardian angel who saved her that night.
Unexplained encounter my brother got on video... 	So, for additional backstory, my brother was alone at my mom's house (probably to check on our dog Oscar as both my mom and step-dad work day jobs) or something along those lines, when the light in our hallway started to turn on and off. My brother began recording in hopes to capture it on video, in which he succeeded.  Now after watching the video countless times, I am stumped and believe there is something beyond our knowledge happening here. Having lived in the house for over 2 years myself, the house does have weird vibes to it but I have never personally witnessed something like this. There are two light switches that control the light, one closest to my brother and on down at the end of the hallway (you can see in the video, left side of the wall). You'll see in the video that the light begins to turn on and off, and on two separate occasions, you can see the switch literally moving. The first time it goes down perfectly halfway, which is very odd to me and would be damn near impossible to recreate so perfectly with anything tied to the switch. The second time, which is much more obvious, the light SLAMS down, in which my brother reacts appropriately by getting the f*** out of there. What are yall's thoughts and opinions on this video? Genuinely curious as to what you all think, as my mom still lives in that house and tells me of weird experiences she has in it.  Thank you!
Okay. Ghosts are real. 	I am right now sitting in my front porch smoking a cigarette. I cannot bring myself to go back inside my house. There is someone in there.  Just over 2 months ago I moved into a new house after losing nearly everything to Covid. I won't go into details or draw this out.  Typing this out is making my eyes well and every hair on my body stand straight up, but God dammit I saw a human shaped shadow in my walk-in closet.  Am I going crazy? Maybe, but I know that I am not at the same time.  Okay, this is what happened. I am laying in my bed browsing reddit, and from the corner of my eye I catch movement coming from my closet. Within literal milliseconds I turn and see someone standing inside of it, looking right at me. You guys. I FLIPPED the fuck out, sprung up, ran out of my room, slammed the door, and grabbed a kitchen knife.  I yelled and screamed about calling police, that I had a knife, and basically acted like a scared monkey.... no response. After about a minute of yelling and realizing I had left my phone in my bedroom (to call 911) I slowly peaked in.  There was simply nothing there you guys. Nothing. No one could have gone anywhere. I'm fucking PISSED and terrified about this.  I saw this person. I saw their shape. Their movement. Their arms. There was a humanoid figure in my closet, and that is all I know.  Idk what to do from here.  Update #1 - Nothing at all. Back in the house.  Update #2 - I took some advice from some of you, and feeling very very silly I spoke loudly and assertively to my empty closet and told the entity to leave.  Update #3 - Nothing has happened still, but I found out some really unfun news. Apparently the previous owner of this house committed suicide. I wasn't able to get anymore information than that. That does NOT make me feel any better. I don't know if they were in the house when they did it, or if they were male or female, or if it is related at all.  I will update this post if anything ever happens again.  Update #5 - I left a comment in this thread to update anyone who cares. I left the house after another incident.
A Being Saved My Life 	Trigger warning: abuse  I will spare y’all the gruesome details, but my grandfather was a sadistic, violent predator. To cover up an affair, my dad dropped me there for the weekend-mom thought we were camping. Grandfather abused me terribly (I was 8). When I regained consciousness, I screamed at him that I would tell what he had done. That pissed him off, so he drug me outside in the middle of the night, and tied me to one of those old, metal lawn chairs. It was Autumn and it was drizzling outside.  I was so cold that night. I’m pretty sure I had hypothermia. I just remember shaking and that the wet and cold hurt.  I was going to die- I felt it. Then there was a bright, blue light. Out of it stepped a tall, thin woman’s with black hair, cut straight and straight bangs. She was wearing white and had a bead necklace. She walked over to me and touched my face, then hugged me. Her skin was so soft and she was so warm. Then she stood behind me. I expected she would untie me and we would go into the light- I thought I was dead. Instead, she put her arms around me, and she had colorful wings. I remember being shocked because I thought angel wings were white.  I immediately got warm, and dry. My muscles relaxed and the aches and pains from grandfather eased. I can still feel the warmth that I felt. I can still remember her floral smell. I never in my life before or since felt as safe as I did in her arms/wings. She stayed until morning. I think grandfather forgot me because he came running out at dawn. He commented that I must have gotten loose because I was dry and everything was still wet out.  In high school we were studying Egyptian mythology. I saw a painting of Aset (Isis) for the first time and knew it was her that had saved my life. To this day, I have a statue of her in my living room to show thanks for saving me.
I saw something on my way home from work that scared me half to death. 	I've posted in here before, & idk if this story is allowed b/c it's not a ghostly experience or haunted house, but I have 0 explanation for the event. Before I tell you my story, I'm gonna give you some context about my drive home from work, the state I live in & such. This happened about 10 minutes after I left work today, July 4th, 2020.  I live in northeast Ohio, & I got a new job about 2 months ago as a process technician at a dairy plant. Iy pays very good money, considering it's a 34, 35 mile drive one way. After about 20 or 25 miles, I drive through a wooded area. Nothin uncommon for me, as where I live in NE Ohio, forests are common, & I pretty much lived in the one behind my Grandma's house growing up. I work 4PM to 4AM, & the drive home sucks. Whether it's being tired, hungry or the fog almost every night, I go the same way every day & night.  I was driving my way home, I just left the residental area of my workplace & was going through the forested area. As I said, there's almost fog every night, so I'm on high alert for deer, raccoons & such critters. It's just like every other drive home so far; I have a podcast on, focusing on the road, thinking of getting either a sausage mcmuffin or mcgriddle from McDonalds, & sometimes looking off to the side of the road for any eyes reflecting off my headlights. All of a sudden, I see some relfecting eyes. Out of the woods comes a coyote. In my hometown, coyotes aren't too rare. I've seen them by my high school, but had never seen one outside of my hometown, so it surprised me. I start slowing down as it crosses the road..until it turns to my car & sits in the road. It sat about 10 feet from my car. There had been no cars I had seen since leaving the residental area, so I was going to go around it, but I thought this was too odd of a thing to happen to just drive away from it. I expected it to just get up & walk away at any given second.  This is where I began to get very scared. I honked my horn, & after about 2 or 3 seconds..it smiles at me. I have my brights on, so I can see it perfectly. This coyote had human shaped teeth. My heart dropped & every hair on my body raised, just as it is now recalling this incident. It lasted about 1 second, before sitting up & running into the woods. I sat there in fear for about 5 seconds, before shoving my foot on the pedal & driving at getaway speed. I didn't stop & get food cause I had, & still have, no appetite. I thought the rest of the ride home what I saw, once doubting I saw it, but like I said, w/ my brights on & it as close to my car as it was, I saw it as clear as day. This coyote had human teeth, & there was no doubt about it. I'm very into the paranormal, & that includes cryptids. Is it possible I ran into a skinwalker or some genetically mutated coyote? I am Native American if that counts for anything. It's so weird typing this out, but I'd like someone who knew more about these things to help out if they can. I know one thing though, & that's I'm finding a new way to work.
When I was 18, my mother took me to a fortune teller. 3 out of 7 prophecies of his already came true. 	Just a little background. I originally come from Ukraine, and I travel a lot all my life. I studied and lived in England from 12 until 21 years old, and now am working on Belgium. My mother knew this fortune teller, who was known to be diagnose diseases just by holding your hand, as well as predict your future (at least key events). My mother was worried about my future since I had so many opportunities, that she took me to see this guy. I had exams coming up, and it was a good way to both distract myself and learn something new.  The guy made a total of 7 predictions. I will first mention the ones that happen and then rest that are yet to be. Just to let you know, this guy lives in a tiny village, and never travelled outside of it, nor does he have access to the internet. Anyway, here goes.  I would get 82% in my exams.  He guessed the exact percent. I was doing well in my studies at all, and I only started studying properly in the last months. He put his hand on my forehead and immediately said i shouldnt worry, as I will get 82% which is what I need to get into a university I wanted. That came true and I went yo university.  2. I have problems with my liver  I was a very healthy kid, and did a lot of sports semi-professionaly. In my school at 18 Years old, I was in a football, rowing and tennis team. I barely drink and eat properly and had a very healthy body composition. After he said I have problems with my liver, we went to a doctor and guess what - I had an enlarged and hardened liver. Doctors had no idea what caused it, and to make it normal I had to do a special diet for 2 months. After that, it all went back to normal.  3. I would travel to Finland for work at 23 years old, but not before then  I had a business trip to Estonia and Finland last December. And guess what - I literally travelled to Finland the day before I turned 24. I had no control over booking the tickets or scheduling this business trip - my management sent me on this mission. I never been to Finland, nor any nordic countries ever.  4. At 28 I will have 1000 employees under my management. (Hasnt happened yet)  I am currently trying to work myself up to become a project manager, but still not sure if its possible for this to happen. Right now I manage around 30 employees, so its a big jump to 1k, but we will see  5. In my entire life, I will travel to Russia only twice (hasnt happend yet)  Due to a political climate between Ukraine and Russia, I havent travelled to Russia ever yet. Although I do want to visit badly.  6. I will marry a blond woman and will have 2 daughters (hasnt happened yet)  It was always a dream of mine to have daughters, not sons. I cant explain why, just always wanted to. I have mostly females in my family (loads of sisters, aunts and grandmas), so lets see  7. I will move and live in Finland most of my life. (Might happen soon)  This is quite unbelievable. He said that when he concentrated on my future, he saw the word "suomi" around me a lot. At the time none of us knew what it was. He also said that I would live and probably die in Finland. When I came home and googled what suomi is, it turned out to be a language spoken in Finland. And as for working there, when I had a business trip, I made some connections with other colleagues, who invited me for some potential working position. So I might end up moving there sooner rather than later.  So thats that. He predicted a lot of things, like prostate cancer in early stage for my dads friend, which saved his life, as well as healing my grandmas depression by one 15 minutes talking session. I dont know if there is anything to this guy, but its sure not just accidents.
I witnessed something with a few friends in the woods 9 years ago that haunts me till this day. 	Me and some of my buddies used to go to this place called Profile Rock in Freetown, Massachusetts, late at night sometimes 2-3 in the morning. One night during the summer I go to profile rock with 3 of my friends at 2:30AM just to mess about and explore. Now I didn't know this at the time but Profile Rock and the area we were in is part of an area called "The Bridgewater Triangle" which is a site of alleged paranormal activities and also one of the most haunted areas in the state I live in.  Continuing on we climbed profile rock itself stayed on top of it for maybe 3-4 hours, and we all decided to leave. Now as you're leaving profile rock you have to go down this long path that's about 2 miles long to get back to where we parked our car. Two of my friends are walking about 20-30ft infront of me and my other friend, now I'll never know why I turned around, I didn't have a feeling like someone was watching us. I just simply turned around because besides the moonlight shining through the trees in certain area's we only had cellphone flashlights to make our way around.  I remember turning around and seeing "someone" running at us from about 150ft away full speed, what threw me off wasn't that they were running at us, it was how they were running. You know how a zombie walks in a horror movie dragging one of its legs almost limping, that's how this "someone" was running at us. At first I didnt say anything and possibly assumed it was one of my friends or someone that was already in there who got injured and needed assistance. Until this "someone" made it to an area of the path where the moonlight reached through the trees and gave them some perspective.  What I saw still chokes me up till this day, you ever see a child try to draw a person? how they make a stick figure most of the time? That's exactly how this "someone" looked, I caught maybe a 10 second glance as it was running under the moonlight lit trees but I saw no distinguishable facial features, no eyes, no mouth and no ears, its arms and legs looked like that of an extremely malnourished person only completely black and it didn't look like skin or any type of clothing from what I could see, I almost can't even describe it tbh and you could blatantly tell it wasn't a mask or one of those Halloween blacked out suits.  I recall calling out to my friend in a panicked voice, who was walking with me, who was now maybe 10ft ahead of myself. I shined my cellphone light on him as he was looking where I was just looking and I could tell right away from his facial expression that I wasn't seeing things, it was now maybe 40ft away from us if that almost the same distance as our friends infront of us and me and my friend just took flight and started running. My two other friends infront of shot around and asked us "what was wrong" and I replied "just run" and all four of us jetted for our car.  I remember taking a glance back as we were running and there was nothing there even though whatever was chasing us would certainly be on our tails by now. We all hopped in the car, and my friend who was walking with me yells "DUDE TELL ME YOU SEEN THAT?!? WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT" I told him I seen the same thing I asked him to describe to all of us what he saw and he described literally the exact same thing I witnessed. By now my other two friends are thinking we were joking around or messing with them. Until my friend who was walking with me swore on his father who has passed away not even a month ago that he's telling the truth. I was kind of frustrated tbh, because I couldn't believe my other two friends didn't see it as they turned around to question why we were running but it doesn't matter now.  We actually went back there with a few more people the day after and witnessed nothing of course, I'll never know what it was or who it was or what it wanted. But I know one thing there's no way in hell two people both imagined seeing some stick figure spectre in the woods...  TL;DR: Me and my friend witnessed a stick figure looking figure chasing us in one of the most haunted areas in my state.
Found kitten on grave 	The following took place yesterday and today:    I had a kitten pass away yesterday. He was my little shadow. He slept on my chest every night, never left my side during the day, and literally gave me kisses all of the time. He would lick my mouth whenever I made the kissy face/noise. He was an amazing little creature. He was only a couple months old. He got a cold, when the weather got hot suddenly, instead of the steady 70's we were used to, he got a little cold. This isn't uncommon. It's similar to allergies in humans.  I immediately took him to the vet to get him some medicine. The vet gave me some medicine for him, but warned me that he may not make it. He passed away yesterday. He was not in pain, he was in my arms, and not alone. I was heartbroken, still am.  So, I bury him in the corner of my garden, a lovely little shaded spot under a tree. I put a couple rocks over his grave and picked some flowers and placed them there. I miss him desperately, and I cried most of yesterday and today. This evening I am going out to my car, and I walk out the front door to head to my car. You must understand that while I buried my kitten in the front garden, when you leave the front door you have to turn to look where he is buried; the path to my car is heading in the opposite direction.  I walk toward my car and I hear a voice in my head "turn around"... I stop because it startled me. But I listen and turn around and look toward my kittens grave. Curled up, sound asleep, on his grave is a small kitten. I walk over slowly because I don't want to startle him. He doesn't startle, but he does wake up and look at me. He appears to be blind. He stretches out and meows and I bend over and pick him up. He immediately starts purring and licking me. Just like my kitten did.  I know this is probably a coincidence… but the timing is amazing. My kitten passes away. I bury him, and the next day I find a little kitten curled up on his grave. I have never seen this kitten before. He by some miracle he was sent to me, I promise I will not take this gift for granted.    UPDATE: Thank you everyone for the kind words and support. I have a vet appointment scheduled for this evening, as it was the first one available. I will post another update after the appointment. The kitten, he is a male, seems to be at least partially blind. He responds to sound and smells, and sometimes walks into things. However, if you get really close to him, he seems to see you a bit. I am wondering if perhaps he has some kind of eye-infection. We will find out tonight.  I still have not decided on a name. Help is appreciated. Marvel is a wonderful name, but I haven't decided yet. He is black and white, his tail is mostly black with speckles of white. He is truly a beautiful little thing. My kitten who passes away (his name was Kane) would have loved this little guy.  Curled up and sleeping soundly.  Update: Kitten has seen the vet. We have decided to name him Eli. Eli has a severe eye infection, and may be permanently blind. He has been given three medications, and hopefully as the infection clears, his sight will come back. But it may not. He is healthy other than the eye infection; no temperature, heart rate and breathing is great. And his bowel movements are good as well. Hahaha he actually pooped on the vet tech during his examine.  Thank you everyone for the well wishes. Eli is currently getting all the cuddles and kisses.    UPDATE: I just wanted to update everyone on the latest. Eli is doing great so far. He is responding really well to his meds. I was just examining his eyes and there is a bit of color behind the filminess. He is so active. He is running around and jumping on things. He is super talkative, he is constantly meowing his adorable kitten meow. I mentioned in a comment below that its like he is narrating his life.  I could not be more proud of this little guy for being so strong.  Also, I just wanted to thank everyone, again, for all the support, prayers, and love. Eli and I can feel your support and we are both grateful. I am so happy I shared my story with all of you. Another thing, I have gotten a few notifications of my phone, telling me about comments and showing me a brief bit of the comment, but when I open up Reddit the comment is nowhere to be seen. I just want you guys to know I am grateful for the kind words, and I am trying to answer as many comments as possible. If I don't reply to you, it could be that the comment disappeared. I don't know if this is a Reddit thing or what, but I want you to know I am not ignoring you. One such comment came in recently, I am not sure who it was from, but they said they had been following my post and that my posts were altruistic, I went to open the notification to read more but the comment was gone. So if the person who wrote that comment reads this: I had to look up what altruistic meant, I believe you called my posts unselfish, and for that I am grateful and I thank you for your kind words. I am sorry I could not finish reading your comment.  Anyway, Eli's next appointment is Friday evening, so hopefully then I will have some definite updates about his sight. Love to you all!  UPDATE: Eli just had his one week follow-up appointment and I am happy to report that he is doing amazing! The vet was so impressed with the progress he has made. She confessed she was nervous they would have to do surgery on his eyes because they were so badly infected, but after todays appointment she happily exclaimed that she believes his eyesight will return. He has already regained some sight, and the vet believes over the next couple weeks his sight should return, hopefully completely! I am so happy that he has overcome to huge hurtle. He is gaining weight and even bossing around his husky older brother. Thank you everyone for the support and love, it is now, and always will be, much appreciated!
My father's dead friend walked me home on Día de los Muertos 	I want to share this experience that happened to me around 15 years ago, when I started study in a town away from my parents home.  There was one man, let's call him 'Tony', which was a good friend of my father, helped him at work sometimes, hence, I hanged out with them usually. When I was 17, I moved to a bigger city to start university, so I traveled every two months to visit my parents for long weekends or vacations.  After my second year away, this friend, Tony, died from alcohol abuse. My father told me on a phone call how did that happened or at least how did he heard it happened.  Around 2 months lather, on Día de muertos (day of the death) here on Mexico, I went to visti my parents, also to go and visit the tombs of the family as the traditions goes. And at this point I literally forgot about Tony's death.  The apparition comes around because, I didn't catched the bus that arrives during the day to my parents hometown, so I was forced to take one that arrives there around 2 am. It is quite a small town, so since I didn't found any taxi near the bus station, I decided walk home. Around 5 blocks away from the house, I had to pass on a bridge where people say that a decapited donkey spirit scares people during the night, I was a bit scared tbh. But then, suddenly this friend, Tony, reached me on his bike (I didn't mention that he always moved on a bike), and asked me if I was just arriving from University.  Maybe because I was originally thinking about the 'decapited donkey' I completely forgot about the fact that Tony was supposed to be dead. So I started to talk to him also, and we walked passing the bridge and a couple more blocks, for around 4 or 5 minutes, talking about the school, the food on the other city, and stuff like that.  Just 1 block away from my parents' house he just told me "ok, I have to go check some things over here (pointing at another direction), but keep safe, say hello to your father for me". We said good bye and then I got home.  Since it was early morning, I walked directly into my room and waited to the next day to go and see my parents.  It was until next morning, when I was just about to tell my father about Tony, that I remembered that he was already dead. At that moment I didn't tell to my parents, but a bit later into the day my father told me that he saw me arriving, he asked me if I was drunk or something because he saw me "talking to nobody"... So then I told him.  I think it was some kind of company on that bridge that I was affraid of because of the stories, and also because of that scare (from the donkey story) I didn't even pay attention to the fact that my company was someone I knew was already dead.  It is kind of funny for me, and actually never felt affraid of that moment. So thanks to that old friend that was there with me even after death.
My friend said goodbye the night he died 	This happened in 2012 and has haunted me/filled me with love ever since.  I woke up one Saturday morning and remembered dreaming about a friend “Dan” apologising that we’d not spoken in a couple of months and saying ‘goodbye’. It made me smile because I missed him and it was really nice to see him, even in a dream.  I got up, went to meet my sister for breakfast and while walking down the road I was logging on to fb to send Dan a message about the dream and just say hi. I wouldn’t normally be on fb this early but wanted to send the message while the dream was still fresh and happy.  A mutual friend of ours had put up a status telling everyone that Dan had had an accident and died during the night. I was, and still am 8 years later, absolutely devastated, he was one of my favourite people who could make me smile without even trying. But I feel so comforted knowing that as he died he came and said goodbye.  I’ve told only a few people about this because it means so much to me, but I’m not really sure anyone has truly believed or understood the significance of it.  Anyway, this is my story, I just thought I’d share  Edit: Thank you all so so much for your lovely words and for sharing your amazing stories. I really hope you’re right and he visited because our relationship was important to him. I wasn’t very good at expressing myself back then so never really told him how much he meant to me. I really hope he knew though.
I just received a hand written letter that is unexplainable. 	I honestly don’t know how to explain this strange hand written letter I received last week. For backstory: my family and I have been staying with my parents for three months because I’ve had some health problems. We didn’t tell a lot of people because we were still in the same town and everyone was sheltering in place anyway. Last Monday my mom told me I had received a letter in the mail and I could tell by her voice she was intrigued. It was strange that I was getting mail at her address as they had only lived there about two years and it had never been my permanent home.  I head downstairs and she hands me a written letter addressed to me but using my maiden name. I’ve been married over ten years and my name is now distinctly different. The return address is in town from “Patty C.” (Names changed obviously). I don’t know anyone by that name. To reiterate, my parents didn’t own this home when I went by my maiden name. So we’re obviously very interested to see the contents of this envelope.  I open it and unfold a hand written note on 9.5x11 ruled notebook paper. The letter is very personal so I won’t type it out but it goes into detail about my health struggles and how this Patty C person cares deeply for me and is praying for me to get better. She wrote like we are best friends. At the bottom she signed her name with a P.s. to call her anytime.  My mom and I are so incredibly confused and concerned about who this person is so I decide to call the number. A woman picks up and I ask for Patty C, the woman pauses and then sighs and explains that her mother, Patty C, died a year and half ago. I apologize and am about to hang up, more bewildered than ever, when this woman (let’s call her Kim) ask why I’m calling for her mother on her (Kim’s) cell phone.  I’m not sure what to say and stumble through an explanation that I received a letter from her mother and it listed this number. Kim is silent for a while. Then she says she’s only had this cell number for 6months, well after her mother’s death. I apologize again and say there must be some mistake and hang up.  My mom and I decided to google the address, it’s a small public park in town.  I’m so confused. Paranormal occurrence Maybe? Extremely strange glitch? Extraordinary coincidence? Who knows. This is going to bother me for the rest of my life.  
I’m either crazy or I rented a house in a straight up evil portal. 	A gold? I’m absolutely flattered. Thank you, kind strangers on the internet!  Updated to add some requested details I am really quite moved by the support I received here today. It felt really good to get it 'out on paper' and the support from all of you were cherries on top! So for that, thank you!  The Valley  Alright, I’ve been lingering about in this group and I’d like to share my story. I’ve always believed in the paranormal until, ironically, I experienced it. I have since moved, and all is well again. Buckle up, we’re going on a journey.  To give you some visuals about the land. It was a crappy old trailer sitting on about 5 acres in a really beautiful valley in the South West. There is a seasonal arroyo which during monsoons would turn the back three acres into nearly a lake. The back half of the property was lined with a wooded ridge, mountainous area. Very rural. About 9 miles from town, down the shittiest dirt road that has ever existed.  As with most adults I entered a period of life with some pretty big obstacles and struggles. It was a sequence of events which led me to renting this run down POS. At the time it seemed serendipitous. An acquaintance had mentioned a property near her I could possibly rent for dirt cheap, while we were hanging out under the new moon.  Fast forward to the next new moon, this property owner contacts me (I’d told her she could give my deets if it came up as available) and after some chatting we agree to meet.  This place was not the Ritz, not even a HoJo. It was a run down trailer that hadn’t been cared for in, probably ever. I believe firmly in listening to my gut but any red flags that came up were squelched by my excitement to maybe have an opportunity to pull myself out of the financial hole I’d dug myself into. He needed work done on the property and would trade for rent. I was swept away at the glimmer of freedom i was staring at. I hands down accepted the keys.  Before moving in, I had to first clean the entire place. So much bleach. As I cleaned out several years of other tenants things, I took note of how many sentimental items had been seemingly abandoned in closets. Some of it I set aside, with no idea what I’d do with it, it just felt wrong to throw it to the dump.  After several weeks of bleaching and blessings, I was nearly ready. I invited a dear friend of mine (M) to come out with me to celebrate. While finalizing the cleaning and working on a broken water pump the acquaintance (now neighbor) comes over with the entire family in tow (two smalls; two teens;husband).  The energy shifted in a way I couldn’t not notice, the husband was behaving....off. He wasn’t being social nor was he being antisocial. In the spirit of don’t rain on my parade I brushed it off. It was discovered the keys had been locked in their vehicle, and he (neighbors husband) would need to go fetch the spares from next door. He invites my friend to go along with him. Leaving me with acquaintance and children. We are chatting and listening to music.  I knew a storm was coming and was feeling excited for an early summer storm. She, on the other hand, was becoming increasingly anxious. She has no, known to me, fear of storms. She is pacing with one of her smalls, looking out the windows for headlights.  I was in the kitchen and she on the porch looking for the returning men when there was the biggest, loudest, Boom I have ever heard. My entire body swayed with it. I said to the kids in the kitchen that Mother Nature was very vocal tonight and giggled to ease their surprise.  The youngest she is holding is screaming and she has come back in the door, absolutely bawling her eyes out. I am completely confused. I take the baby to comfort him and I hold her in my other arm.  She cries and weeps for the next however many minutes until the men arrive. She departs shortly thereafter. Her husband is absolutely invigorated and my friend is quite obviously shook.  Turns out, they were driving on the road back when the lighting struck the ground directly next to their vehicle. Scaring my friend half to death. The strange part though was the drive takes less than three minutes, but from the boom (lightening striking) and when they arrived was at least 20 minutes.  After the neighbor family departs, my friend is ready to go. Go, right now.  After arriving home and checking in with one another we had done so. He tells me he loves me but he will never go out there again. At the time I thought maybe he was just really freaked by that freak storm and it would pass. He never would come back, and in fact our relationship took a nose dive after this.  Fast forward to move in time.  I’ve got all my stuff in place, and my dog, rabbit, & cat seem very content to have places to play. I was feeling so good that this was my ticket. I had a bonfire soon after, and burned all those items I’d kept when cleaning the house. It just felt right to let them go ceremonially.  The first night I had a nightmare. The worst I have had in many years. I kept waking up and falling right back in. Each waking I awoke screaming. I know I know, it sounds dramatic. It was.  Dream This dream took place entirely at this new place. I was so afraid. No one would help me. There was one of the teen boys curled up in the corner wearing flower patterned swim short type things, he wouldn’t answer my pleas. I kept peeking out windows into the blackness, knowing there was something outside. I finally summoned the courage to open the door. On the doorstep were snakes. Green snakes twisted around one another. I screamed for some to call the neighbor and he needed to bring a gun. He arrives and gets out of his truck with a shovel and a nonchalant way about him. End Dream  The nightmare left me a little on edge, as when I have nightmares I’m typically under stress and I didn’t feel stressed in the least.  Two days later I am lounging in my hammock enjoying the sun and watching the rabbit and the cat play in the fenced area while the pup is sniffing about outside looking for treasures. I hear a very loud noise near the dog and simultaneously the dog jumps back.  I go to investigate and there’s a damn rattlesnake right outside the fence. I have never in my life seen one or heard one for that matter. I decide I have to “take care” of it bc of the cat and rabbits safety. I know there’s a pellet gun inside that might do the trick. I stare at this snake a moment longer, it looks weird. That’s when I see the second head. Never have I seen ONE rattlesnake in my years of life but here I am staring at TWO all entangled together. I immediately decide this job is above my pay grade and I call the neighbor over and ask him to bring a gun.  A few moments pass and he arrives. The moment he exits the truck I flash back to my nightmare and my breathe just caught in my throat. He exits the vehicle; with a shovel and a sardonic grin. His teen exits as well; wearing the exact shorts I had dreamt and was uninterested in being there so he was quiet.  He dispatched both snakes, noting to me how dangerous it may be for me to live here without a gun. His tone and look made my skin crawl.  As time went on the nightmares grew worse, but were Always at the property. I would wake up screaming multiple times per night. In my nightmares I would scream ‘bruja’, a word I have Never used in my life was now a frequenter inside my minds eye.  The dreams shifted to images of something dark and slimy (I can’t describe what it looked like but I “knew” it’s texture) in the back room.  The back room was vacant because after moving in I had felt increasingly uneasy in that space. I couldn’t go near it in the dark without feeling fear so deep I wanted to vomit.  The neighbors around me became increasingly rude and seemed to making a point to make me feel unwanted.  I finally got to the point, I was terrified to be there and was so sleep deprived I called on a shaman to come visit me to help me bless and clear whatever weird things were hanging on. She asked me what exactly was happening that made me feel I needed an outsider. I told her. She asked me where it was. I told her. She was quiet. She told me no. She would not visit and it was her advice I leave, and leave immediately.  I wasn’t ready to give up that easily and told her no. I would not be chased away.  I called around until I was connected with two women who agreed to come perform a cleansing for me. During this we walked the yard and came to the bonfire ring and she dead stopped. What did you burn?! I was kind of taken aback at her tone but I told her and she says You shouldn’t have done that.  Directly after that she informs me she needs to leave. I never heard from her again.  I became increasingly isolated as anyone who would visit me, wouldn’t revisit. Dear friends who point blank told me the area made them uncomfortable.  I began to wake in the night between 1-3am, every single morning. One of those time I woke to a deep male voice, saying words I could not discern. Another a woman’s voice saying words I could not discern. Yet again a deep male voice saying “I’m not ready yet”.  These incidents left me feeling crazy. There had to be an explanation. Had to be. This is where I should say my belief in the paranormal was tested and I realized I don’t think I had ever Really believed.  One morning I feel myself wake but I do not open my eyes and I say in minds voice No. I will not look at you. I drifted back to sleep, I was suddenly awoken this time it felt like I had a fever my body was so hot and my minds voice says It’s time to wake up. I glance at my phone and it’s 230am.  I downloaded a sleep recorder, because why not. And what I captured was....a thing. The most distinguishable was a woman’s voice, saying Come Home. Another was singing in the far distance. Another was a woman’s voice screaming Shut Up! (In true no evidence style, I deleted that app as soon as I moved)  It was around this time I started seeing the thing in my peripheral vision, in the kitchen.  My dog would growl at windows into the darkness and wake up barking often throughout the entire duration. She was aggressive to every single neighbor and my landlord, but no one else.  A few things to summarize  On about 2 miles of road there were about 11 properties which had been seemingly abandoned in the middle of the night, leaving behind all their possessions.  The items I burned were love letters, children’s cards to their mother, and items such as that which had value.  I placed cameras outside hoping to find a person coming and messing with me, the only thing I ever caught was a big deer coming through  I was told by ghost chasing types, this place was a portal being used by other worldly things  When I moved the neighbor dropped by on my last night and point blank told me I couldn’t leave, he wouldn’t let me The night the neighbor came over There was a lot of rambling that evening. Some it included random comments about me being a Scorpio and him a Leo, he was stronger than me. That I knew what I had done. (Mind you, at this point my partner had moved back from the east coast and was there that evening). He said I couldn’t leave and I couldn’t take him (my partner) either.  There’s a lot and nothing to say about it. Nothing ever came from it, I moved and have never looked back!  There was a man who lived down the whom was suspected of spray painting strange things into abandoned houses. One of them said ‘Keep out! Krampus is watching” at some point it was a painted over to show only the words “is watching”.  On multiple occasions various vehicles would stop on the road by my driveway and sit there. This was not a traveled road by any stretch.  So, coupled with the unexplained, there was a lot downright strange human behavior too.  Please don’t chastise me for lack of evidence  It was the absolute worst 8 months of my life  I contacted multiple shaman/seer/ghost people during this time and all told me under no uncertain terms that I needed to move and I needed to move immediately. *The reasons why varied. I think I can summarize it down to the area was full of nasties which they were not willing to work with and these nasties meant me no good. *  I reconnected with my dear friend after I had moved from the terrible place  I’m curious to see what the community has to say about this and admittedly a little nervous. This entire experience tested what I believe.
My son reacted to a thought that came across my mind while he was sleeping 	My 3yr old son was sleeping next to me in my bed last night.  Let me ask you something, does anybody else, when really tired and just as you start to try an go to sleep, get a random word or phrase thrown into your head automatically by a random voice that’s louder than your usual thoughts? This usually seems to happen to me as I start to try an sleep. The words or quick phrases never really makes sense, and I don’t ever feel a presence near me or anything. It’s literally just someone else’s voice yelling into my mind really quick. Just seems like some weird glitch while my mind is starting to go into sleep mode or something. Doesn’t feel paranormal at all.  Well.. last night the phrase was by a woman’s voice saying “Enjoy Happiness” and RIGHT after it was said in MY head, my son (sleep talking) said “I enjoy!” Like as if he was agreeing with the statement.  It’s just too bizarre to be a coincidence, it’s like we had the same thought at the same exact time..  I swear there’s so much more to this life than we know..
The Hospital Medium 	In 2002, my youngest  brother unfortunately passed away from cancer at the age of 5. When he was alive, he would always request pennies from people- family, friends, doctors, etc. At the time of his passing he had collected a water cooler jug full of pennies, and we buried him with a huge bag of them.   Over the years we have randomly found pennies- on family outings, whenever we are feeling down, etc., and  have always taken it as a sign of him saying hello. My dad was always skeptical of this, and has always had a hard time with his passing.    One day, my dad was in the waiting room at the hospital to see his doctor when he saw this old lady. She had a walker and was mumbling to herself. She kept swatting at the air and shaking her head. Finally, she approached my dad and said "I normally don't do this, but he won't leave me alone. Did you lose a young son?"My dad shook his head yes. "He wants to know if you are getting..the pennies? Does that mean anything to you? He wants you to know he is okay, and that they are from him." My said "thank you" and she walked away.    A few moments later after my dad fully realized what happened, he got up to find her to ask her more questions, but he couldn't find her, and he has yet to see her again.    No one other than our family knew about the pennies, certainly not some random lady at the hospital. Now when we find pennies, my dad knows my brother is okay, and will happily pick them up and put them in his pocket. 
My grandma has something interesting to say about aliens 	Today the Area 51 thing was on the news and my grandma, unbothered, looks at me and goes, “you know aliens landed [on our local beach] in the 70s. They keep their ship hidden under the sand. That’s why we haven’t had a hurricane since.”  Now listen y’all. My grandma is a very old school, conservative, religious woman we don’t even joke around with. When she said this I thought she was joking but she just went back to watching the news like she hadn’t said anything to me.  *For context my aunt is one of my neighbors.  Later when I went to check my mail I saw my aunt sitting on her lawn and went to tell her what my grandma said. Again, unbothered, my aunt goes yes that’s true. That’s why that part of the beach is sectioned off. ??? I was for sure some kind of elaborate prank was going . But later I saw another neighbor and told them the craziness and they agreed. I looked it up and there’s a bunch of news stories of the town claiming that the reason major storms won’t hit my area even though we are in a high risk zone for hurricanes is because of the aliens protecting their ship.
My dying son may have seen a sister he never knew or heard about. 	Years ago, in early 2000, I suffered a bad miscarriage. I was about 10 weeks along. My husband and I weren't able to find out if it was a boy or a girl due to how early it was in my pregnancy and the technology wasn't what it is today.  About a week before all hell broke loose, I had a very vivid dream, which I still remember to this day, that I gave birth to a baby girl who looked back at me and smiled. That's the only part I remember - she popped out, turned around, and smiled. A week later I started bleeding.  I have never mentioned my miscarriage to my kids. Never even talked about it.  Fast forward to present day. My husband and I have two wonderful boys. Our 17 year old, however, has terminal cancer. He is also autistic. I mention the autism because over the past few years he has always asked what "..." (our cat that passed away years ago) is doing in Heaven.  Just last week, he started to talk about his sister in Heaven. My hands are shaking as I type this. He mentions his grandfathers, both of whom have passed, and different people he met along the way. I never told him about my pregnancy loss, and I don't think he'd understand if he found out.  I've heard that some people with a terminal illness can sometimes "see" things, and he has said some pretty wild things thanks to the autism. But he asks what his sister in Heaven is doing.  Just a thought, but I think our first child is with her family members, and watching over us.     This is where we are; the doctor put him on oral chemo drugs, on a 28 day cycle. He had a bad reaction and kept getting sick. It tore my heart out to see his health decline. My husband and I made the decision to stop all chemo, since his situation is beyond help at this point. The oral chemo would buy us time, but it would put him through hell. Since he is terminal, we just left it in God's hands.  He is doing well now, and according to the hospice nurse, patients who stop chemo tend to have a "rebound." He's at that stage. But we know what's next. (Religious tangent coming up) I know he won't be alone. My dad, my mother-in-law, and countless other family members will take care of him until I get up there, whenever that will be.  Again, thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who has reached out.
Heard a gunshot in my dream. Woke up to my mom telling me my aunt shot herself. 	This happened a few years back and I never told my mother or my father since it was a sensitive subject. Had a dream my friend Dylan and I were in a two story home. He was showing me his new guitar. We’re having a good time, joking around, when we hear a gunshot downstairs. We look at each other and book it down the stairs. When I hit the bottom step, I wake up to my mom on my bed in tears. She tells me my aunt who lived on the other side of the country, has committed suicide. When I ask what happened, she told me she shot herself.  We weren’t ever close as she lived 1,500 miles away from me. My father had a rough childhood, she was his half sister and a bit older than he was. I never met her in person, it was just such an odd moment. Like I said, I’ve never told anyone. Just my current husband and my best friend at the time. I never knew what to make of it.
My grandmother with Alzheimer’s did something weird four days before she died 	Title explains it, my grandma suffered for nine years with Alzheimer’s before she passed. She lost any ability to speak (other than mumbling jibberish quietly), feed herself, or do much of anything around year seven.  When she was moved to hospice, my mom and I visited her every day. Four days before she died, my mother and I were sitting and talking to her. Out of nowhere, she began praying the Hail Mary and speaking perfectly. She said the whole prayer three times in a row before she stopped. That was the last time she ever spoke. It was really amazing to be there and I still can’t believe it happened. May her soul rest in peace
I watch security cameras for a living and I saw something that sent chills down my spine. 	So I saw this about 4 years ago at work and it creeped me the fuck out... I work for a digital surveillance company that runs the "eye in the sky" for thousands of restaurants, bars, and gas stations across the US. From time to time we get calls for investigations to look into robberies, theft, ect.  So one day we get a call from a popular fast food chain located in the heart of Detroit. They say an employee OD'd by the dumpster and they needed us to get some answers on the situation...  First, basically what happened and how long was he there? The next question is where it starts to get weird...  See, the dumpster had a brick wall around it. It had two entrances to the dumpster, a gate you had to pass when you walked out the back door and the big gates where the garbage truck has access to the dumpster to empty it out. They claimed those big gates were ALWAYS open and the small gate by the back door was locked from the inside. Nobody ever used that smaller gate. The weird thing was when the body was found an employee walked out, that gate that was NEVER open was indeed open, and the body was sitting there on full display -- so their next question was WHO THE FUCK OPENED THAT GATE?  So we download the footage. One night the employee goes outside, throws out the trash, and you can kinda see him through the locked gate that was never open (it was see through but very difficult to see though). The way the camera was angled you could kinda see over the top also. He injects himself, slumps over, and keels over dead behind the dumpster. He was out there for two and a half days. No employees ever come to look for him. It's pouring rain both days. For two days employees come and go taking out the trash and not seeing him. Then, on the third day in the morning sunshine, clear as fucking day, the gate just... slowly opens by itself. Nobody comes, nobody goes. The gate just fucking ... opens... by itself and the body is sitting there in the same position it was 2.5 days earlier. I literally felt chills down my spine. To this day i can't explain it without thinking it was paranormal...  Anyway, a couple hours later an employee walks out with a trash bag, sees the body, freaks out and calls the police. I didn't write it, but we basically had to write a report on how a gate apparently opened itself...
My experiences with the Bell Witch haunting 	I lived in Adams, Tennessee growing up from about ages 14-18 (2004-2008). A couple of weeks after my family and I moved there something unexpected happened.  I was mowing on my dad's tractor (with a big 8 ft wide back-end mower), I was going down a hill when my horizon line violently was thrown around as the tractor tires hit something. I disengaged the mower, pulled the tractor around at the base of the hill I had just gone down.  My blood went cold as I look up through the swathe I had just cut. Like a buzzer going down the middle of someone's head making a lane in the grass. In that lane were 4 native American burial graves. My parents started reaching out to anyone who might be able to help us identify the graves: anthropologists, historians, accredited people, etc. Those people unanimously agreed that these 4 graves were from the Trail of Tears.  They corroborated this from what I remember because of how the graves were laid (very very shallow, with a giant slab of stone where a gravestone would be), the fact that they were interned on a hill side to keep the water from sinking in and raising the bodies since they had to bury them so quickly, and many other reasons.  I consider myself a very logically driven and rationally minded person, basically I let my empirical senses try to explain something before I'll open myself to other possibilities. Yet, there were things that happened to me and my whole family that we weren't able to rationalize with the scientific mindset or anything logical.  Event 1: The activity in our house started shortly after the mowing incident. We heard heavy knocking and pounding on the brick outer wall of the house, encircling the house (no matter where you were in the house you could hear the knocking). Some nights I would hear running footsteps accompanying the pounding. This activity happened nearly every night.  As the nights passed I started feeling a heavy presence in my room, a suffocating one, like a heavy weight sitting on my solar plexus constantly. Whatever was happening decided to latch onto me.  Event 2: Things continued to escalate. One night I was letting my golden retriever out to go pee. We had a ranch-style house overlooking the Red River. The door we were exiting was on the backside of the house facing the river. As I open the door I start hearing faint whispering something akin to leaves being blown/scratching across the ground.  I looked up at the trees to see if the wind was blowing, everything was perfectly still (it was fall in Tennessee, so tons of leaves on the ground, they were not moving either). The scratchy/blowing leave noise continued, but as it continued it grew closer and louder. It sounded like a language of some sort like how'd you imagine an incantation or something nefarious in the tone of the sound.  I looked down at my golden retriever. ALL of the hair on her back was standing up and she was snarling like a rabid wolf, yet not barking just kind of frozen in a fear response. I started getting extremely nauseous and could smell sulfur. I was completely frozen when my dog launches herself through the door's threshold and starts gnashing her teeth mid air snarling and chomping.  The voices were now coming from directly in front of me, I could hear them as if someone was standing there a foot or two away. I grab my dog mid air and pull her quickly inside, slammed the door and threw the dead bolt into place.  The door and frame shook violently as a vicious pounding started hammering on the threshold. I ran with my dog to the center of the house, flipping on every light along the way.  We sat there alone all night until the sun came up. Ginger, my golden retriever laid across my lap the entire night pressing into me while she whimpered for hours.  All I could do was pet her and try to calm her down, which was also helping me down-regulate. This was impossible though, the entire night until sunrise, the back door was thumping.  Event 3: It happened when I was coming home from football practice. I had all my gear in a gym bag over my left shoulder. This is important, because of how I entered the house. As I closed the front door behind me, I began sitting down the gear bag from my left side which caused me to look right.  The room when you first walked in was our "library" where we had a leather couch, chair, piano, book shelves, and a wooden rocking chair. There was something sitting in the rocking chair.  My peripheral vision caught it first, the chair going back and forth. As my vision centered on the chair there was a humanoid looking shape sitting there, head glancing downward at the book it was holding.  Long black hair drawn down over its head and completely void of light. To picture what I saw, imagine the silhouette of a person, but rather a "void" of light.  The light coming in around the edges of it seemed to be eaten up by the presence/void, as the light spilled over the contour edges of the humanoid shape (like how black holes are visualized, almost exactly).  It felt like I had jumped off a bridge into ice cold water, I blasted myself backwards against the door screaming and fell down. As I was falling I saw the "void" blur suddenly as it shot across the walls of the house and out through a huge bay window over looking the river.  My golden retriever was in the next room and she sprinted to chase the shadow across the walls...barking and clawing at the walls. After it left through the window my dog came to me and laid on my lap until my parents got home.  Event 4: I was fishing with my cousin Jack on the river by our house. We were right on the bend of a river, so the moon would be shining on both sides of the river racing out at two lines like a 90 degree angle from the house, super beautiful when you weren't on edge. The reason I bring this up, there was a lot of light on the river that evening. Jack was about 10 or so at the time, he reaches up and taps me, "Does that lady need help?"  I looked to where he was pointing and there was a pale woman dressed in white clothes going back and forth picking up stones just to the left of us across the river. I had seen her many times before around the property, and whenever I would get close she would disappear behind a tree or something similar would happen.  Knowing this, I told Jack as calmly as I could that it was time for dinner and he needed to go up to my Mom immediately (in an attempt to not scare him). When I walked him up and made sure he was on his way I looked back over and she was gone, but I could hear a splashing in the water below.  Event 5: Myself, my dad, his friends, and some other family members were staked out along the river bend on the gravel bar beneath the rise to our house. Nothing out of the ordinary at first, it was July 4th and we were having an actual good time for a change.  We were all spread out about 15 yards from each other. Each man had a low end gas Coleman lantern. As the sun was setting my Dad looks over at me like something was bugging him. He told me later he felt like someone had just thrown a bucket of ice water over him before it began.  The sun had just gone down when this happened... In unison all the lanterns were cranked up full blast, then just as quickly became barely a flame, then the fires roared to life again, down to barely a flame, roared to life, then they went completely out. Right as the flames went out, we heard the most god forsaken scream by some woman across the river.  Whatever it was kept on screaming despite our best attempts to call out to help. As her scream reached a crescendo, it sounded like what I could only imagine a person's throat being cut interrupted her scream. The sound of a dead weight fall of a human body tumbled down the hillside across from us and splashed violently into the water.  At this point all the guys had their flashlights out. That's when something started swimming and splashing around in the water on both sides of the river bend. The splashing receded towards the opposite gravel bar, and whatever it was got out and started pacing back and forth across the rocks there. We were pointing all of our flashlights to where the sound was coming from but we couldn't identify where it was originating. It's safe to say we were running up the hill at this point.  We all got inside the house, locked the doors, then gathered in the central living room. No body wanted to leave for fear of what was outside. We all stayed up that night because the wall pounding was more violent than it had ever been. Bam. Bam. Bam. All night like the ticking of some demonic clock. I didn't sleep for 2 days after this event.  Event 6: Lost time. I was walking through the woods near the Bell Witch Cave. One moment it was completely sunny and blue skies about mid-afternoon. The next moment it was overcast and looked like maybe 4pm.  Event 7: Night terrors. Torture dreams, being held down and brutally drawn & quartered, dreams of walking through the house and the "void" person placing their hand on my chest and "pushing" through my solar plexus, body violently shaking in the dream like a having a seizure.  Event 8: Visited the Bell house/plantation marker in a tobacco field adjacent to my family's property. Brought friends to try and prove that something crazy was happening to my family.  The rite of passage in the area is to go to the stone marker where the paranormal events happened hundreds of years ago, then dance on the stone saying "I don't believe in the Bell Witch!" I got them to promise that they wouldn't do that while we went.  Of course the moment we get there, one guy who doubted the legends in a massive way, jumps up onto the stone marker and starts screaming "I don't believe in the Bell Witch!" as loud as he could. I get so upset at him. I'm the only one that knows the way back, so I said come on guys we're leaving. In this area it's known as the Tennessee River Valley. So there's tons of flowing water etc around these tobacco fields. The reason this is important is because of what happened next.  We're making good time walking back across this crop field, hundreds of yards long. A mist starts rolling in from the river bends and begins to saturate the field. The temperature drops easily 25 degrees or so and we start seeing our breath. I begin to smell sulfur in the breeze. As the mist became a fog it began. I started hearing this wheezy and deeply cavernous sounding breath around us....like being inside a cave that was breathing.  Out of nowhere we started hearing these giant blasting sounds and I realized something was walking on the chopped tobacco stalks. (Side note: when they harvest tobacco they use a machete and cut down at a 45 degree angle leaving about 3.5 feet of brittle stalk poking out of the ground).  When you step on said stalks, they disintegrate in a very loud way as they burst apart. This starts happening all around us like an army of native spirits running around as if we were in a bandwagon battle, the blasts were coming from every single direction in the fog.  That's when I hear it, that deep cavernous noise turns into this giant sniffing sound, like some Lovecraftian beast smelling its prey just out of eye sight. At this point I yell RUN in pure panic mode.  We take off across the field trying not to trip and be skewered on the stalks (they dry out and get really sharp where they harvest them, also Robertson county is the world's largest producer of tobacco per square mile, so these fields are everywhere, fun fact).  As we are exiting the field and our feet hit the gravel road, the lower center part of my back suddenly EXPLODES in agony. I look down and there's a massive rock laying at my feet and I realized that I had just been assaulted. By the time I got to my house and examined my back in a mirror, the bruise was about the size of a basketball and was already turning black.  Event 8: Woke up outside about 3 in the morning. I was laying next to the 4 graves on the property. The night was awfully cold but I woke up soaked in sweat. We lived there for so long that I have many events to share, process, and willing to have discussions about my time there with you all.  It is really hard for me to talk about this stuff without re-traumatizing myself, but my friends and family are encouraging me to share my experiences with like minded people so I can try to find peace surrounding my trauma.  Thank you for reading.  (edit: spelling)  (edit 2: thanks for all the kind words and support this community has shown me, it truly means the world to me, much love to all of you).  (edit 3: per community request, I've written down a few more of the events in the comments below in a chain I started, sort by best to find it easy)  Anyone who has been to the cave will tell you that it’s lit with really dim led light strings, at least when I went, and there are no direct paths for the sunlight to come in and create such intense overexposures in the camera lens.)  (Edit 5: trying to reply to all the comments as they come, keep asking questions and I’ll try and get to you as soon as I can.)  (Edit 8: This is what the thing that was following us in event 8 sounded like. I smoked cigarettes pretty heavy until recently, so it wasn't too hard to remake the sound. I'll never forget it, this sound is scarred into my memory:
I'm not from here. This has been a long time coming. 	Let me start off by saying this will be a long read. I'm also going to tell you that what I'm about to type is something I've carried with me for the last 24 years, and I haven't really spoken much about it since I was a child, and I've never spoken about it on any kind of public forum such as this. You are free to not believe me. I in fact, encourage you to doubt anything that you're told from anyone. I'm typing this message because as I've gotten older and I've spent over two decades developing a life, to the best of my ability, I've carried an immense weight on my shoulders that neither therapist nor psychiatrist treat as anything other than a method of repressing memories at best, and the delusions of a lunatic at worst. I do not blame you if you draw those same conclusions. I'm typing this in what I believe has become the most publicly traded speaking-place on the internet for the sole purpose of attempting to drop the weight I've carried and move on with my life. This is more of a personal cleanse, than an attempt at intrigue, and if no one reads this message and it becomes buried among the innumerable posts on Reddit, I will have at least gotten it off my chest.  I, am not from here. And by "here," I don't mean where I currently live. I mean where any of us live. Anyone reading this, right now. It's now a few days after my 30th birthday, and this time of year always strikes me, because I started kingergarten on my birthday, when I turned five. I thought, at the time, everyone did that. You turned five, and when you turned five you go to school. I didn't realize my birthday just happened to coincide with the first day of school. And a little over one year later, in about two weeks' time, it will have been 24 years to the day that my entire world vanished. I was born in San Diego, and lived in a poorer suburb of San Diego as a child. I lived at an apartment complex called "Lemonvine Apartments," that were a bit slummier versions of the Lemmonvine apartments found in Lemon Grove (A suburb of San Diego). My parents were divorced, but friendly. My mother was was young when she had me, and she was beautiful. She was in her early 20's and was aspiring to be a model and would regularly take trips to LA to do photoshoots. She did glamour modeling for magazines. She had a darker skin tone, being one quarter Indian (Indian, not native) and it gave her an "exotic" look. My favorite picture of her as a child was her modeling a luxurious wedding dress for a bridal company. I used to sleep with that picture when she would go to LA, and I would stay with my Dad, who worked for the city of San Diego. They shared custody pretty evenly, and we even did Christmas together as a family even though they had split when I was still a baby. My dad, his girlfriend, my mom, who was single, and me. Maybe things weren't as good between them as I remember, but, I was 6. So if there was drama behind the scenes they did a good job of hiding it from me.  On September 17th, 1996, I was staying with my dad's parents in Riverside California. They had a small farm where they raised chickens, pigs, and goats. No horses or sheep or anything. But my grandma had several pet ducks that would eat seed from your hand, fly away and return every year like clockwork. My dad had to work at night for a week and my mom was in LA, so I stayed with my grandparents. Schools back then were pretty cool with this kind of thing, and I was sent home with the sorts of nonsense assignments you'd expect of a first-grader who'd just gone back to school after Summer break ended. The 17th was the third day I was staying with my grandparents, and my grandpa had told me to be careful outside, because he'd seen a rattlesnake and wasn't sure where it had went. So, since no one knew where the mystery snake had gotten off to, six-year-old me, decided to go hunting for it. In hindsight, letting a 6-year-old go looking around a farm for a rattlesnake was probably not in any parenting 101 handbook, but it was the 90's and I guess they didn't actually expect me to find it. There were woods on the property but I wasn't allowed to go in there, so they probably figured that's where the snake had gotten off to. I spent all day outside playing jungle exploration on the farm, trying to track down this rattlesnake. And, much to my excitement, when I decided to open the well house (Which, for those who don't have one, looks kind of like one of the green electrical boxes on the side of the road) there it was. Curled up, rattling away. I immediately slammed the door shut, and ran to my grandparents' house to tell them I'd found it. Now this might be my six-year-old memory exaggerating, but I'm pretty sure that snake was at least 900 feet long. Give or take. I found it though. I was excited to tell my grandpa I found the snake, so he could.... do what he did, and go out and shoot the thing. I ran in the back door of the house, which lead you into the laundry room and through the kitchen, I paid no mind to anything until I turned left and entered the living room, expecting to see my grandparents, my uncle, and the neighbor couple all sat in the living room where I'd left them. Except they weren't there. And it wasn't the same living room anymore.  The furniture was completely wrong. The hard and memorably-uncomfortable hardwood furniture my grandpa loved so much was gone. The coffee table he made out of a tree stump was gone. Replaced by fluffy grandma-looking furniture. A three-person sofa with a floral design on it, the TV was in the wrong place, and newer than my grandpa's old "sit on the ground" cabinet TV. The hardwood panneling on the walls was gone, or at least covered by blue wallpaper. The hardwood floor was a shaggy off-white carpet. The pictures of my Dad, my uncle, me, and my grandparents were gone from the walls. Replaced by paintings and pictures of people I didn't know. As confused as I was by this, I was more confused by everyone being missing. In my 6-year-old brain, I accepted that they may have completely rearranged the house while I'd spent the day looking for a snake, but I didn't believe at all that they'd all just leave me alone. And I didn't see anyone leave, I didn't see the cars go down the road. So I walked out the front door, which was attached to the living room (As..they usually are) and thought maybe they'd gone to the chickens or the pigs. Both should have been visible from the front porch, but the chicken coop was gone, and the pig pen had lost its fencing, and there were no pigs to be found.  At this point I was beyond confused, and I was getting very scared. I didn't want to be alone, and I didn't see anyone. Even though they lived on a small farm, the neighbors that had been visiting lived just across the dirt road, so I ran down our own dirt driveway and across the road to their house, assuming that MUST have been where they went. I remember getting more and more scared as I ran to their house, and I remember starting to cry when their house was the wrong color. It wasn't the faded yellow house it used to be. It wasn't even the right house anymore. Never the less, I banged on the door. I remember that at this point I was crying quite profusely, because I didn't understand what was happening, and I kept wiping my face, which covered it in dirt after having been digging around under stumps and logs for snakes all day. When the door opened, and a woman in her late 40's to early 50's answered, and I'd never seen her before, I just started bawling uncontrollably. Everything after this point is largely a blur, because nothing was right. I knew where I lived. I knew where I went to school. I knew where my grandparents lived. But I met the people who lived where my grandparents lived, and they were not my grandparents. I did not know them. I begged for them to get my uncle to tell them who I was. But my uncle wasn't there. Through a series of various police and people in suits I was brought back to the town I lived in after spending what seemed like 10 hours in the local police station trying to contact my parents. I had my home phone number memorized, but told them my dad would be asleep. But when they called that number, the person on the other end had no idea who I was, or what they were talking about. I was asked to give the police officers my address, and sat in the local police station while the police in my home town went to my address. When they finally called the station back, they were informed that the name of the apartment building was incorrect. Lemonvine Apartments didn't exist, and the address I gave them was to an apartment complex called Merit Manor. And the apartment number I gave them was unoccupied. I believe at this point they were operating under the assumption that I had given them the wrong name of the apartments, and the wrong apartment number, but I did in fact live there. When I was finally brought to my home town, after changing hands a couple times between police, I was asked to give the police officers my address again, and was driven to where I lived.  That was it, that was my apartment complex. But, just like everything else, it looked wrong. It was painted a different color and the sign that used to have a large image of a Lemon reading "Lemonvine" now read "Merit Manor." I took the police to exactly where I lived, and just as they'd said, no one lived there. From this point forward, the police attempted to contact neighbors, all of whom knew me, but none of them were who they were supposed to be. Every person who came out of the apartment buildings around me were the wrong people. And they didn't know me. From this point they attempted to contact my father, which should have been easy, as he worked for the city. But no employee by his name apparently worked for the city in any capacity. As day turned to night, and I spent endless hours sitting in the police station as they attempted to find any person in the world who knew me, I couldn't do anything but cry, and cry, and cry, endlessly. A woman in a suit who I think was either a detective or just someone who happened to work in the station sat with me for several hours and tried to keep me calm. She gave me a stuffed dog. A dalmatian puppy that looked a bit like one of the dogs from 101 Dalmatians, and told me his name was Sparky. She said I could keep Sparky, and that when they found my parents, Sparky would go home with me and make sure I didn't get lost again. She said he was a good dog, and he'd protect me, if I took care of him. During this time they attempted my school. I told them I went to Shawnee Elementary. It was easy to find, it was really close to where I lived. But a school by such a name, you guessed it, did not exist. My school was now apparently called "Anza Elementary." At one point I was asked if the police had ever taken my fingerprints, and they had. In kindergarten my entire class had our fingerprints taken by the police at the school gym, for.... basically exactly this reason. Unsurprisingly, this did not help, at all. They couldn't find my parents. My grandparents. My neighbors. My apartment, or even me. They couldn't even find me. I was too young to remember what my social security number was, but I severely doubt it mattered. They asked my birthday, and any relevant information that could help them figure out who I was and where I belonged, but nothing I told them turned up any information about me. At some point during the day I was briefly taken to the ER, as the police suspected I may have sustained some kind of head injury. After being looked over by a doctor, they found nothing wrong with me, and I was sent back to the police station.  I ended up staying with someone that night, I'm not entirely sure who it was. Someone from child services I imagine. I couldn't stop crying long enough to really focus on what was happening after this point. I'd cried myself to sleep several times in the police station and cried myself to sleep again at the house I stayed at that night, despite the woman who I was staying with (not the same woman who gave me Sparky) doing everything in her power to calm me. I clung to Sparky so hard I'm surprised I never popped his head off. I didn't have my picture of my mom. I didn't know what was going on, and no one could find out where I belonged. This didn't make sense to me. I was only 6, and just barely. I lived were I lived and my parents were my parents and my school was my school. They didn't just all disappear one day. In between fits of crying and waking up I begged to go home. I begged for the lady I was staying with to try and call my dad again. I just kept begging to go home.  Over the next few days, I was interrogated and questioned by different people at different times at different places at all hours of the day. Police, investigators, people from departments I still don't know, child psychologists, everyone under the sun was asking me questions. I was back and forth between the police station and the house I was staying at, until eventually someone told me that they thought they'd located my parents and they were coming to get me. Finally, I was going home. Finally, this was over. Finally, I could get away from all of these strange people asking me the same questions over and over again. When the couple showed up to the police station, my heart fell into my feet as they were not my parents. But they'd had a son that had gone missing, and I fit his description pretty closely. The woman started crying when she saw me, because she immediately knew I wasn't her missing son. But I was out of tears to cry at this point. Eventually I was collected by Child Services and I was taken to a foster family where I stayed for a few months. The police launched a campaign, asking for anyone to come forward with information about me. They took my picture at the police station for the news papers, to put on the news. I never let go of Sparky for even a second. They didn't want me to hold him in the photo because I didn't have him when I arrived, but I needed him, and would throw an immense tantrum when someone tried to take him away. They had me put back on the clothes I was wearing when they found me, but they'd since given me new clothes to wear.  In those months I spent at the foster home, parents of missing children would come to the house to see if I was their child. I didn't realize this was what was happening until I was older and looked back on it. They didn't just pull me out and say "Is this your kid?" They were a bit more subtle about it. The parents would come to "meet me," and upon realizing I was not their missing child, they'd often leave in tears. Looking back at all these families that came to see me in desperation that they were going to have their child back, I feel so horrible for them. It's a feeling I can't really explain. Like a type of guilt, like I wish I had been their child so they could have them back, and know they were safe. Most of those people probably never saw their children again, but I try and imagine that all of them were reunited, even though I know that isn't likely. This guilt was one of the things that kept me in therapy as an adult, but like I said, no therapist has ever bought my story or believed what I've said. The most common belief suggested to me has always been that I was abandoned as a child and lived in an abusive home, dumped on the side of a dirt road in the middle of farm land and I repressed all the negative memories I had of my past.  I didn't stay in that foster home permanently. Eventually, while my case wasn't officially closed, I needed to start going to school, and I needed identification. I was issued a birth certificate for the date that I told them was my birth year, but the day and month were listed as September 17th, the day that I was "found." I never understood why they didn't just use the day and month of my actual birth, but I imagine it was because they didn't think I actually knew what it was. My name was unchanged. I started going to school sporadically. One of the child psychologists who had seen me recommended I not be placed back into a full curriculum immediately, and suspected I suffered some form of PTSD. I was put in the "special" class, and was only made to go to school twice a week initially. Eventually I started going to school full time and changed foster homes a few more times. I really can't say how much time passed before it happened, but eventually, I was placed up for adoption. I was never actually told I was up for adoption, so I'm not sure how soon after I was "found" it was. But eventually people started coming to meet me, but these people weren't looking for a missing child, they were looking to adopt one. But I definitely did not represent myself as a good candidate. I had a story that no one believed or could verify, I insisted my parents would eventually find me, and I rarely had a day that I wasn't crying until my eyes burned.  This story doesn't have a happy ending. I never saw my parents again, and I was a ward of the state until I was 18, and went nowhere from there. My teens were filled with delinquency and I did a brief stint in something similar to Juvi in San Diego called "Chaparral." I never went to college, and never really started getting my life together until I was around 24. I haven't talked publicly about this before now, at least not since I was a child speaking to everyone who was trying to figure out where I came from. I still have Sparky. He's old, and worn. Still in one piece. No longer white, he's now a dark shade of grey. He sits on my dresser, and is there, just like he always has been, as long as I've been here.  So, Q&A: While I haven't publicly brought this up or spoken about it in any large-scale fashion, I've told the story to people who wanted to listen and I've gotten one question, understandably, repeatedly (Including from my shrink), so before you ask it, I'll try and answer it as best I can. Q: What things are different in the place you came from compared to where you are now?" A: I'm not really sure. I've been asked about countries, states, laws, planets, languages, you name it. The fact is, I don't really know. I was 6. The continents could have been completely different and I'd have no idea. I wasn't particularly bright, either. I mean, I was hunting for rattlesnakes. I also thought California was a country. I can say, the president of the United States was not Bill Clinton. I can't remember exactly what his name was, but we had to learn it in kindergarten. I believe his name was Robert something or other. I want to say Robert Willmer but don't quote me on that.  Anyway, that's my story. I doubt anyone will read this, and it will likely be buried 10 pages deep in fifteen minutes, but it's now off my chest, in the open, and I can go to sleep with hopefully a little bit of weight off. ..............  Edit: I genuinely didn't think this post would be noticed at all so I went to bed after I posted it and haven't checked it until now. When I get off work tonight I'll try and answer everyone's questions to the best of my ability.  Double edit: This post has garnered way, way more attention than I ever expected. At the time of this edit there are well over 300 comments and nearly 1000 upvotes, and my inbox is full of messages. I'm trying to respond to everyone's questions as best I can manage or am able, but it's currently very late and I will have to sleep soon, and then I'll return to replying after work tomorrow. I thank everyone for their support, and to the people that don't believe my story, you have the right and every reason to hold that belief. As people have begun investigating this, I am asking that if you find reports from the 90's of my story online, to please not post them publicly. I have a family now, and I don't want them to be harassed or accosted. Please feel free to privately message me (The inbox works best, I'm still trying to figure out the messenger system) and I'll respond to any questions you might have as quickly as I possibly can.  
My girlfriend and I are either crazy, or being severly harassed by something. 	As a warning, this is going to be a very long post. It may exceed the maximum characters, and as to follow the rules I may have to continue the story in the comments. I will try to be as concise, and organized as possible. This is my third draft trying to tell the story as neatly as possible. There has been many different events, and there are a lot of details to comb through.  The reason I'm making this post is to share my experience, but also to possibly seek advice. This has reached a breaking point that has left me scared, and ready to possibly seek help. Be it a spiritual medium, an exorcist, or a psychologist.  I believe that something is harassing myself, my girlfriend, my house, my family, and very importantly my children. I do not think this is a passive being, and every time something new happens I believe more and more that this is possibly dangerous.  To give some backstory. I am 26, and my girlfriend is 22. We are going to call her B. Because we like bees. B and I have been friends for many years, but we have only been dating for a little over a year. I have children from a previously failed marriage. They visit on the weekends. After the divorce I moved back in with my parents to restart, and get back on my feet. I no longer live there, but I found this information relevant as it is where most of the story takes place. I often travel for my job, and this is also relevant, but not until much later in the story.  B sees things. She also hears things. She has described many horrifying visions, and sounds. I knew that she experienced this, and while I have also had my own experiences I've never experienced anything like what she describes. I have never judged her for what she describes, and I have always kept an open mind. I believe in the paranormal, but I also believe in people needing psychiatric help. I have always thought that B's experiences are one or the other, but as for which one has always been irrelevant to me. I am here for her, and when the time comes that things reach a boil, that I will continue to be there for her.  It did not take long after we started dating for me to also share some of her experiences. They started off very simple, and easy to brush off. Not feeling right in certain parts of the house, feeling watched, seeing a shadow thing in my vision. These are the kinds of things that we naturally write off as tricks of the imagination, stress, or what-have-you. Even though we'd both see it at the same time.  She says that the things she usually sees are not of great detail. If she was to observe them she would never be able to make out details, nor make sense of words that she hears. No facial details, clothing details, anything of that nature. I don't know if this just means that they are pure black, or if they are more of a blur.  She says there are two exceptions. Two things that she has seen repeatedly throughout her life, and they are the only two things that she's ever been able to make details out of.  Tub Man, and Nose Guy. I believe it is best to not give them names, but this is what she calls them.  Tub man she has seen in several houses. Her childhood home, our friend's house, and others. She describes him as being skinny and lanky, and wearing red shoes. She has never seen his top half too well, or his face. Because whenever she sees him he's already halfway in the tub. That's it. She'll see him crawling from the floor into the tub as if he was a spider, and she always catches those red shoes of his. I want to say she said he's in normal clothes, but I can't say for certain. The shoes are what stand out.  Nose man on the other hand, she has only seen in her childhood home. And he's not so much a man, as he is a nose. I know this sounds silly, like some sort of Cronenberg monster. A giant fleshy nose man that just looks at her, and watches her. If he even has eyes, I'm not sure.  Now I know this may not seem relevant, but trust me, I have tried to leave out any details that I find irrelevant.  I'm now going to delve into our experiences together.  When you enter my parents house there is the living room immediately in front, the kitchen to your left through the passway with the pantry and garage door, and stairs to your right. So left, kitchen. Front, living room. Right, stairs. Stairs going up, and stairs going down. Upstairs is my sister's room, and my parents room. Downstairs is another small living space, a bathroom, and what became mine and B's room.  I'm going to mostly skip over all of the smaller experiences of us not feeling right in that smaller living space downstairs. To be brief, until we had moved in it had went mostly unused, and shortly after we had moved in I had realized I did not like one particular corner of the room. Neither did B. There were a lot of times where we would find the lights on in closets downstairs when nobody was home, or in the middle of the night. Sometimes when we would pass by to go to the bedroom we would feel like something was rushing at us.  The first real experience for both of us that I can remember that really had us freaked out was while she was using the bathroom. I was in the bedroom, which is directly next to the bathroom, lying in bed on my phone. It was about midday, and she had come back into the bedroom and asked what I wanted. I was not sure what she meant, and had asked her to explain. She had said I was knocking on the bathroom door, and was asking to come in. She had said it was locked, and she had asked me to wait. I had assured her that it was definitely not me, and that I would have heard someone knocking at the door. She seemed a bit frazzled, and had assured me that it was definitely my voice.  Jump to us both showering one day. We had wrapped up, and gotten dressed in the bathroom. She went to leave, and said something is holding the door shut. I was in disbelief, so I came over and turned the handle firmly but slowly, and opened the door. It barely had cracked open before, and I swear on my life, the handle VERY firmly twisted the other way in my fucking hand and had pulled shut. I immediately swung the door open and rushed out of the bathroom to confront whoever was there, but of course, there was nobody there.  This is almost a year ago now, but if I'm trying to keep a chronological order I believe this is what happened next. I was off at work, and she was still in bed. She had heard my computer chair creaking multiple times. She felt someone was in the room, and had pulled the blanket up over her head a bit and taken a peek. She later described to me a pale and gaunt woman sitting in my chair. Smiling. Smiling, and staring at her. I do not remember if she said there was something unnatural about her smile, but I believe it seemed like a large smile. Also, she had eyes. Not blank, not black. I do not recall what color her hair or eyes were, as I am colorblind and that detail did not stick with me. My ears work, my eyes don't, but regardless I don't remember. Tho, if I recall her hair was not black, and it was a lighter color such as blond or a soft brown. Long and thin. I wish I had asked more about this woman, such as what she was wearing, or any descriptive features. B seemed very stressed out about this incident. So I did not push for any more details.  The reason this stressed her out so bad was because she could see the woman. It wasn't like all the other times. She was like Nose Guy, and Tub Man. She could see every detail of her.  She turned back over, pretended to sleep, and waited for me to get home.  I did not see her.  Before covid had gotten too bad, and us being ignorant of how bad it was going to be we had taken a trip to Michigan. The whole family, except for my sister. She had stayed behind and watched the house, and fed the animals. We were gone for the week, and B and I had gotten home the following weekend before my parents. It was already late at night. We were unpacking the car, and she had ran inside. I kept unpacking, but was suddenly overwhelmed with this sickening feeling of being watched. It was worse than any time before. And for some reason I kept looking to the side to the house that lead around to the back of the house. I eventually had grabbed some luggage, and rushed inside. I had gotten inside, and closed the front door. Immediately my attention was drawn to the window in the back. I couldn't see anything there, but it felt like something was looking right back at me. Just out of sight in the darkness. And then I had noticed, to my right, one of our cats was also sitting and just staring at the window. I tried snapping my fingers, and saying her name. She didn't even flick her little ears. She just stared. B had come back upstairs, and we went outside to grab some more luggage. I had mentioned to her that I felt like I was being watched. I had not mentioned the window, but then she immediately jumped in and said she felt like someone was watching her from the back window. We hurriedly got everything inside, and talked to my sister. We asked her how the week was, and she said everything was fine. We noticed that she was in her room, and while that makes perfect sense for any teenage girl to be sitting in her room, it isn't like her. She always sits in the living room, surrounded by all the animals, and watches YouTube videos on the TV. We asked her if anything seems strange while we were gone, but we were very vague. She too, had filled in the blanks. Even pointing to that same window. She said she had not left her room anymore than she possibly had to in the last few days because suddenly she felt like she was being watched from that window.  We eventually grabbed flashlights, and investigated the backyard. Obviously to no avail. So we moved on.  The next event seems strange to note, but just like everything else, bare with me. There's a reason I'm taking note of it.  While I was staying with my parents I unfortunately didn't have a bed for both of the children. They both slept on the same bed, really it was a pull out mattress from the sofa, in the downstairs living space. Yeah, it's not an amazing set up, but I was trying to do what I could to just see my girls. I would set them up at night in that bed and give them each one of their favorite stuffed animals, and I'd let them watch TV with almost no volume just to help them fall asleep. I'm aware that I really shouldn't let them have the TV on when they're sleeping, but I sympathize with the idea of being scared of the dark. As an adult, I still sleep with the TV on. Or rather at least some noise like a fan, music, or some kind of light. I don't like tea or dark on top of pure silence. Maybe I'm a scaredy-cat, but the point is I let the girls keep the TV on.  Okay, maybe some of that detail is unnecessary, but it's my story to tell.  My youngest daughter is known to get up, and seek out an adult. For no real reason, other than probably comfort. She doesn't come crying, scared, or anything of that nature. She just kind of gets up, finds an adult, and is like, "Hey. Can I hang out here too?" but not in so many words.   To which, you usually just have to tell her it's bedtime, and to go lie down. She'll go right back to bed. It's just something she does.  So one night we had noticed that more than usual she did not seem to want to stay in bed. Usually, she'll just knock on the door. And I'll send her back to bed. And this happened a couple of times. But the only time she would go upstairs was if she heard someone else such as my dad. So on this night, with her continuing to get out of bed, we wanted to know if there was a particular reason. So we had our lights off, and we had cracked the door. We were keeping an eye on her, and after a short period. We seen her get up again. We didn't hear anything, or see anything that would have made her get up and check if someone was there. But she walked over to the bottom of the stairs, and just stared up the stairs. For a really uncomfortable amount of time. We watched her, unsure what to do. Obviously, we knew we needed to put her back down, but I think we were just curious if she was just going to turn around and knock on the door again, or go lie back down herself.  There is, and I need to stress this, almost NO lights upstairs. I mean, you can't really see anything. Everyone is asleep. There's not a single sound. The only glow of light is not from the middle floor, but the upstairs hallway.   She starts climbing the stairs. It's a short set of stairs, but she's climbing. She reaches the top, and B and I slowly open the door, and come out. As quietly as we possibly could, we climb the stairs after her. She had went through the small passageway in between the pantry and the garage into the kitchen. And she's just fucking standing there. In the dark. We can barely see her. She's standing in the middle of the kitchen, and staring into the blackness towards the corner of the kitchen by the window above the sink.  Take note of the window above the sink.  After an uncomfortable amount of time we say her name, and she jolts a bit, turns around, says hi and comes up and gives me a hug. We asked her if something's wrong, and what she's doing. She quite literally shrugs her little shoulders, points to the kitchen window area, and then puts her head on me.  So we take her downstairs, put her to bed, and we don't sleep right away until the uneasy feeling passes.  Again, trying to keep things chronological. The next incident I can think of happened in the middle of the day while my girls were visiting. My girls are very young, but I'm not going to disclose their ages. I will say one of them is young enough to not quite make coherent sentences, but she does love to talk. The older of the two is no longer a toddler. She's a kid, and before I know it, she'll be a teenager.  My dad, B, and I were outside putting together a swing set for my kids. Which if you've ever put one together then you know that it's not as fun as using the swingset. It's actually quite a hassle. And it was taking a lot more time than we had thought it was going to. Admittedly, I don't recall where my mother or my sister were, but I do recall that they were not there. So we had set the children up at the kitchen table with some kinetic sand and Legos. Figured that could be some good messy fun for us to clean up after building the swingset. We would work on the swing set, and go in to check on the children from time to time. I should note that the children can see us from the window, and we could see them. The window was even open.  B suddenly described feeling sick to me. Like something wasn't right. So I asked her to check on the children, and kept on with the swing set. She went in, and was immediately struck with an even worse feeling. She asked my oldest daughter where her sister was, and she said she went upstairs with mawmaw (my mother).  My mom isn't fucking home.   Even writing that out made me feel nauseous. Probably because my children are involved.  B ran upstairs, and she described feeling a weird sensation. As she describes it, when she was talking to my daughter she couldn't hear anything else. But as she reached the top of the stairs she could very clearly hear my younger daughter screaming and crying that she wanted out. She tried the door, and it was locked. She ran downstairs to get a butterknife, and rushed back up. Unlocked it, went inside, and she had to unlock my parents bathroom door as well. She got her out, and held her. She said she had dried tears on her face, but she couldn't have been gone that long. We were constantly keeping an eye on them through the window even as we worked on the swingset. And B said she could hear her yelling the whole time all of a sudden after she reached the top of the stairs. All the way back in the kitchen she could hear her. Why couldn't she before, and why hadn't my older daughter heard her the whole time? Not to mention she knows how to lock and unlock doors so how did she end up in that situation in the first place? Did she just start to panic, and couldn't get the door unlocked?  I still think about my daughter saying she went upstairs with mawmaw.  I feel like something is luring my daughter, and the idea of that woman that B seen makes me feel fucking sick.  I just thought of a detail that's kind of important for later. My parents have the master bedroom, of course. They have their own bathroom attached, and then from the bathroom is how you enter their closet. It's a walk-in closet. It's a very strange set up since it's somewhat of a series of doors, and it's kind of bougie. But hey, it's not my house.  Some time passes, and my brother and his wife visit. Everything goes as normal, and it's a good time. We play some Animal Crossing, and we all hang out. They're getting ready to leave, and somehow spooky stories are brought up. They were brought up by my brother's wife. Just fun stories. But we start telling them about some things that we've experienced in the house. They exchanged glances in an almost cartoon fashion.  My brother's wife then asked us to go outside. I was puzzled, but we went outside. She then elaborated that she was afraid someone was in our house. And she did not want them to hear us. Like a squatter in our attic or something.  They began sharing stories of how bothered they have been in the past at this house. These were all before we had moved in. Some of which I don't recall, and at the time I could not relate to. Some others were similar to our experiences in that the same closets, and the same rooms would have their lights on with the doors closed, and some doors would open or close when they weren't looking.   Three of the stories stood out to B and I so I will briefly tell those.  First, my brother was playing the new Star Wars game on his PS4 downstairs. His wife was upstairs. He had seen someone in the corner of his eye walk down the stairs, and go in the bathroom and close the door. They had turned the light on as well, but after they closed the door. He had assumed it was his wife.   His wife was still upstairs, and when he had realize that she had opened the bathroom door, and nobody was in it.   This is bothersome because it is the same bathroom where B had heard my voice when I wasn't there, and where something had turned the handle and closed the door when B and I were trying to open the door.  Second, they were feeding the animals while the rest of the family was out of town. Again, we did not live there yet. So my parents and my sister were out of town. They were feeding both dogs, and both cats all weekend long. Randomly, in the middle of the week they could no longer find one of the cats. They had searched all over the house. Finally, they had gone upstairs and checked my parents room. They had run out of options, but they had not checked it previously because they had no reason over the whole weekend to go into my parents room. The cat was not in my parents room. Nor was it in the bathroom. It was in the fucking closet.  You remember that set up I mentioned earlier? How does a cat go through three doors, and get stuck in the closet when nobody is home? This situation bothered me because it reminded me of what happened with my younger daughter.  It's also a good time to note that we constantly find the cats in the closets. Sometimes we don't even let them out. For example, when everyone in the house is sleeping, but her and I (we play hella games all night) we would go to the middle level to get food, hear a door click open, look upstairs and see the male cat walk out of the towel closet very nonchalantly. This has happened three different times. Nobody let him out. The door just opens, and he walks out.  Third story from my brother and his wife, and this one is kind of simple. They were house-sitting again as they often did for my parents. My brother was staying up playing games on his laptop, and he had went outside to smoke. He was sitting on the bench outside, and this bench is right outside of the kitchen. Towards the back of the house. He had been there for some time, and the light from the kitchen window was shining across the ground. He said a woman had walked into the window. And she was just standing there in the window. He said it scared him because he knew it was not his wife. The silhouette did not look like her, and he knew she was asleep. When he finally mustered up the courage to stand up and take a look in the window there was nobody there. The the shadow was gone. When he had went back inside he had confirmed that his wife had been sleeping the whole time.   The reason the story bothers me as well is because that window would be the window where my daughter was staring in the middle of the dark of the kitchen that night.  One experience my sister was a part of was when I was on my way to work. I got a text from B. She was still in bed, but all it said was, "something is in the room." And a follow up message about things getting knocked over, and she's too scared to get out of bed. It's like 5:30 am, and still dark. I knew my sister would be up that early because… well. She's unhealthy. Much like us. So I called her, and asked her to go check on B. She went downstairs, and turned the light on. When she did she seen that my fan was knocked over, and all the stuff on my dresser was knocked over as well. This is all on the opposite side of the room where B is in bed. So they fixed everything, and kept the lights on until the sun came up.  There are only two more stories before we are caught up with the present moment. Both of these stories are the most recent, and they have both happened in the past 30 days. But they both concerned me, because they both tie all the events together, but also make them all much harder to understand.  As I had said before, I travel for work. Especially right now as the area of Indiana that I'm in is considered a red zone for Covid. So all the local work has pretty much shut down.  So about a month ago we were on our way to a job in Georgia. There's not much to really set up for what happened because it happened very suddenly. We've been driving for many hours already, but we weren't overly tired or anything. We always stop for naps in the car, or anything like that if we think we're getting too tired on a long road trip. We've been driving on the highway for most of the trip, but as we're getting close to the destination the GPS had taken us off onto some local roads for the rest of the trip. Which we found odd because I didn't think Albany was that off the beaten path. We had gotten onto a decent stretch of road in the backwoods of Georgia on our way to Albany, but we still had a ways to go.  We both had started to feel a little off about the road we were on. Nothing too specific, but just that feeling that creeps up on you, you know? Realizing that I could always turn on my brights since I'm no longer on the highway, and maybe it would help us feel a little better to be able to see more of what's around us I decided that that was what I would do.  No sooner than had I turned on my lights I could see something on the side of the road. It was coming out of the woods, and towards the road. I could not make out what it was, and then we were passing it. As we had gotten closer and I was able to distinguish it more I can only describe it as a gray (even for my eyes being somewhat colorblind), human sized, fleshy, shaking thing. Not shaking like a bag blowing in the wind, or fabric caught on a tree. Besides, I had clearly watched it come from inside the woods. It was shaking like it was having a convulsion.  You ever see the Silent Hill movie? Remember that thing on the road that attacks the cop lady? Like a person gift wrapped in their own skin? Like that, but less person and more shaky. Same color though.  I instantly asked if she had seen what I had just seen, and she was thoroughly freaked out, and described exactly what I had seen. She said it looked like it was the same fleshy material that nose guy always was.  Now, this part is strange to me because it's a bit of a departure from everything else we've experienced. It seems entirely unrelated to everything else (besides her relation to nose guy), but it's important to me because it's the first unexplainable thing I've ever seen for myself.  Every story until now has happened around me. I have felt them, everyone's stories keep matching up, and I did feel something close the door. But this was the first thing I seen with my own eyes.  My dumb ass needed closure so I actually turned the car around to go check what it was. There wasn't anything there. No semi-truck tarp caught on a tree, no amalgamation of small garbage bags creating a larger scarier garbage bag, and no spooky Silent Hill monster.  I was a bit shaken though.  Now this is the last, and most recent story.  I'm currently in Pasco, Washington. Another job. It was, altogether with naps and food stops, over a two day drive. We made the usual rest stops off the toll road at those designated rest areas.  Everything was totally normal, but at one of the rest areas we had split and went in our own respective rest rooms. Myself to the men's, and her to the ladies room. I had gotten out before her, and was checking out the snack machines.  Which… Wisconsin. Why do you have cheese curds, and pickles in your snack machines?  Anyway, when she came out I had taken note that she came out of the ladies room on the opposite side of the rest area. I didn't think too much of it, but I did notice it. She seemed off, but we kept moving on.  Thinking back, I should have asked her if she was alright. Rest areas can be shady.  So we drove for another day, and we were about 6 hours away from our destination. I remember looking at the woods next to us, and remembering the thing we had seen in Georgia. I got thinking about everything, and I had asked her if it was relieving that I had seen it as well.  My logic here is that she's always questioned herself, and the things she sees. Since she's the only one that has seen them. I think that's natural. She said that it's relieving that I seen it, but it also terrifies her because it makes her wonder if everything else is in her head or if they're all real. She said if they're all real then she doesn't want to be alive anymore.  Which… Is super heavy, but I don't blame her. If she's seen things like what I had her whole life then I don't know if I'd want to continue either.  So I got thinking about everything again, and I asked her out of nowhere if she thought that woman she saw was what lured my daughter upstairs.  She started panicking. I mean, scared for her life. She started crying, and telling me no, no, no, don't talk about her. She was so afraid. She started looking in the back of the car to make sure she wasn't in the car.  This idea, and her panic, terrified me too, of course.  She told me through her tears, that the previous day at that rest area when she had went into the first women's room that when she went around the corner and looked in… that she was there. She slowly lifted her head above the wall of the stall, and looked right at her. I assume with that same smile she told me about before, but I can't say for certain. I didn't want to ask.  I just tried to calm her down. She didn't want me to talk about her, or bring her up. She thought that even the fact that I had thought about her and mentioned her wasn't a coincidence. I reassured her that it was, but it made me question it as well. We haven't spoken about that in so long that it is pretty coincidental.  The reason it terrified her so much was because this is the second time she's seen her. Only Tub Man, and Nose Guy have ever been repeating.  Now she is too.  The idea that something like that could follow us out of state scared me more than anything.  That's really all I've got. I've spent pretty much all day typing this up, and trying to make it coherent. I don't know if anyone is really going to get through all of this, but I'm kind of desperate.  I need to know if anyone has had similar experiences, if anyone knows anything about this, if we need a medium, or if we both need psychiatric help. I don't know what to do.  There are so many little details, and bits and pieces that I've probably missed. I've done the best I could to try and explain everything I found important. I hope I haven't forgotten anything to big.   Thank you for reading if you've made it this far.  Also, unrelated, but if anyone is concerned about how much we travel during these times, we very much keep to ourselves. We distance from everyone at stops, keep to ourselves at home, and my work is on oil tanks. The only people I run into are on my crew.  I can not provide evidence of any of the things we've seen. Only pictures of animals, the house, points on the map, pictures of the places we've been. Even being in Washington right now. Basically, I can back up every detail of my life… Except the paranormal part.  I guess if that was easier then everyone would believe tho, wouldn't they?  Thanks for your time, and please help me.  EDIT:  At this point I have read every single comment and reply, and I'll address a few repeated notions/questions.  Confusion over my trips.  Michigan was a quick one week trip there and back. Georgia was a job, and also a there and back to Indiana. Wisconsin was on my way from Indiana to Washington.  My parents having experiences.  I've never asked my parents about experiences they've had, or anything of the sort. My reasoning mostly being that they're highly skeptic of... everything. Logical to a fault, if that's possible. My dad would be more likely to believe because his own mother believed her house was haunted (not the house we lived in), but I think he just decides its easier not to bother with.  Anything like this happening before B?  Yes, and no. Nothing of this caliber. I've seen shadows in the corners of my vision, felt I was being watched, had a particularly strange and bad dream of being stabbed by a knife in my house that nobody was holding.  But that's a dream, and those types of things are so much easier to write off as paranoia and tricks of the mind. I hardly think they were ever anything else.  Compliments.  I just thought it was fun that so many people enjoyed my writing. I wasn't expecting that because I was just trying to tell things the way they happened in a reasonable fashion.  Full disclosure, I did three drafts in my Google docs before posting, and the one I ended up using was done entirely by voice, and just proof read and edited after.  So I just really appreciate it because it gave me a happy feeling about something I've felt so terrible about lately.  Lastly, I just really appreciate the support, and well wishes. Again, I've read everything so don't think I've missed what you've advised if I haven't replied directly. I've taken note of a lot, and honestly, I feel so much more confident about everything. I hope I can help B to feel the same.  So much love, guys. Thank you.  Last edit: It is 12/31/2020, and I know this is anticlimactic but I see people asking for updates. Unfortunately, this isn't a film because I have no update. Maybe I should say fortunately since that means things have been calm. Just bad feelings, and the normal paranoid stuff.  The other last thing is people have gone through my previous posts and comments, and are now asking about my son. I mentioned my failed marriage. That was my step-son. I'm not insulting anyone, but I didn't think that would be impossible to put together, but it doesn't look like anyone considered the possibility of step-children existing. It's fine and all. In my past comments I mentioned my wife being abusive, and I have talked about my son because quite frankly, he was for all intents and purposes, my son. But during the time frame of the story I have shared this is no longer the case.
Almost a year after posting this, I still get requests from people asking to share my story. Thought it was worth sharing again. I watch security cams for a living and saw something creepy: 	So I saw this about 4 years ago at work and it creeped me the fuck out... I work for a digital surveillance company that runs the "eye in the sky" for thousands of restaurants, bars, and gas stations across the US. From time to time we get calls for investigations to look into robberies, theft, ect.  So one day we get a call from a popular fast food chain located in the heart of Detroit. They say an employee OD'd by the dumpster and they needed us to get some answers on the situation...  First, basically what happened and how long was he there? The next question is where it starts to get weird...  See, the dumpster had a brick wall around it. It had two entrances to the dumpster, a gate you had to pass when you walked out the back door and the big gates where the garbage truck has access to the dumpster to empty it out. They claimed those big gates were ALWAYS open and the small gate by the back door was locked from the inside. Nobody ever used that smaller gate. The weird thing was when the body was found an employee walked out, that gate that was NEVER open was indeed open, and the body was sitting there on full display -- so their next question was WHO THE FUCK OPENED THAT GATE?  So we download the footage. One night the employee goes outside, throws out the trash, and you can kinda see him through the locked gate that was never open (it was see through but very difficult to see though). The way the camera was angled you could kinda see over the top also. He injects himself, slumps over, and keels over dead behind the dumpster. He was out there for two and a half days. No employees ever come to look for him. It's pouring rain both days. For two days employees come and go taking out the trash and not seeing him. Then, on the third day in the morning sunshine, clear as fucking day, the gate just... slowly opens by itself. Nobody comes, nobody goes. The gate just fucking ... opens... by itself and the body is sitting there in the same position it was 2.5 days earlier. I literally felt chills down my spine. To this day i can't explain it without thinking it was paranormal...  Anyway, a couple hours later an employee walks out with a trash bag, sees the body, freaks out and calls the police. I didn't write it, but we basically had to write a report on how a gate apparently opened itself...  EDIT: So my old main boss dude the first time i posted this that kinda sucked was fired and the new guy likes me, so I'm gonna try to get anything i can. I don't even know if he would have access to any of it at this point...but if i do it won't be video because i wouldn't be able to download anything archived. Best case senario he finds the report and i can grab a cell pic to set the scene for you guys.  Also, i got clarification that it was a fast food restaurant known for their...submersive pastries... in an area made famous by a popular Eminem movie.  
Truly the most terrifying experience I've ever had 	So one night my wife, son, and I went to stay over at my wife's parents house. It had gotten dark and my son(about 2 at the time) got sleepy so I decided to put him to bed. Let me try to explain the room to you(relevant for later).  The door opens on the right side of the room, immediately to your left is the light switch and the queen size bed is just beside that. Its a small room, just big enough for the bed and enough room to walk around the bed. The wall in front of the bed has a window. To the left of the bed is a closet with those weird accordion doors.  I'm laying in bed with the lights out with my son who is laying his head on my arm. He finally falls asleep, and I just lie there for a few minutes to make sure he is completely out.  Then out of nowhere I get this horrible feeling, goose bumps, hair standing up on my neck and arms. It was such an evil feeling. Have you ever got goose bumps up your scalp where it feels like you scalp is shrinking? I did that night, so bad in fact it literally felt like some one had a hand on my head squeezing it.  I was genuinely scared. Not so much for me, but for my son. Some how I knew deep down if I turn away from my son, something bad will happen to him.  I thought if I could turn on the light I could grab my son and leave the room. So where I was on the bed, I could just barely touch the plastic bezel thing on the light switch. I was afraid to move because I knew if I did what ever this thing is, it will get my son. ( his head was on my arm this whole time)  So I finally chanced it. I jerked my arm out from my son and turned on the light. It honestly took a split second. When I turned back to grab him, he was at the bottom of the mattress, like something had pulled him from the top to the bottom in a split freaking second. And I know he didn't crawl down there because he was still fast asleep.  So I grabbed him up and we left the room and slept in the front room that night.  Something evil wanted my child...that is truly terrifying.  
My dead cousin is bribing me. 	My cousin Lloyd passed away a couple of years ago. He had a bad relationship with his daughter, due to choosing his new wife (her step mother) over her.  His daughter never forgave him and poor Lloyd spent his last years desperately trying to apologize for his horrendous mistakes and make peace, and to try and meet his only granddaughter.  Lloyd came to realise that family is everything. It's the only important thing in this life. Sadly he never did see his daughter or granddaughter.  Lloyd would spend his holidays with my family instead. We loved him and tried to give him that family connection he was so desperate for.  Last year I had an enormous fight with my mum and blocked her. About 2 months after that, things started going missing.  It was just little things at first, once every week or two. One of my favourite makeup brushes, my good hand cream, my favourite lipstick, my hairbrush, perfume, and worst, my engagement ring, just small, very personal items and only my stuff. And they were all items that have a designated place that I don't put down anywhere else.  Over time it became more and more items and more and more frequently, until I'd put something down, and as soon as I'd reach for it again, it'd be gone. This was happening daily. It was driving me crazy. My house had become super active (for it), the footsteps could be heard at all hours, day and night, doors opening and closing, TV turning itself on in the middle of the night, the guitars strumming themselves, whispering, lights turning on and off, etc. I kept asking for my things back to no avail.  Then 2 of my dogs paperwork folders went missing. These folders contain all of my dogs important paperwork - pedigree papers, vaccination certificates, champion titles, etc. (I breed & show my dogs) And right now I need both of these particular dogs folders, as one is about to be bred and the other needs her booster vaccination and I need her Vax cert to take to the vet with me. I have 10 dogs, and keep these folders all together in my filing cabinet. Only these 2 were missing.  Finally it clicked. Bloody Lloyd was behind this. I don't know why I made the connection, perhaps I could feel it was him, idk.  At this stage I hadn't spoken to my mum in 11 months, and I knew that's what Lloyd was upset about. So I unblocked her number in my phone and told Lloyd to "stop already, I'm doin' it."  A few days later I get a text from my mum and I answer it. We start talking again. The activity stops. Not another thing goes missing. The house is back to its normal level of activity, not the freak show it had become.  I start asking Lloyd for my stuff back. Nothing.  A week goes by and it's my mum's birthday. I buy her a gift and go around to her place and have a visit.  When I get home, I walk through the door and step on my missing engagement ring. "You little beauty! Thanks Lloyd!" I say.  Later that night I find my fav makeup brush on the floor of my bedroom. I vacuumed this morning, it definitely wasn't there then. Again "Thanks Lloyd!"  Yesterday I went out of town to do some Christmas shopping and as well as buying some presents for other people, I bought my mum a present. I came home and my 2 dogs folders were on the dining room table. There's nothing else on that table, ever.  So my dead cousin Lloyd is using theft and bribery to make me have a relationship with my mum. If you knew Lloyd, you'd know it was absolutely his style. Family is the most important thing.
Something is pretending to be and now my daughter. Multiple witnesses. 	So normally I try to rationalize most experiences, but I can't not shake the last few days and neither can my family. If anyone has any ideas, help a girl out. These things have happened over the last 4 days:  My daughter comes running down the stairs asking "what did you want mom?". I'm cooking and haven't said a word to anyone for the last half hour. She swears I called her, but we chalk it to a voice outside, etc.  Next night, I'm laying down getting ready for bed. My husband bursts into our bedroom and asks "omg, are you ok?", shaking me to make sure I'm alive. I look at him like he's crazy. He says he heard me call him downstairs. He asked what? I did not answer. Then a few seconds later he hears me screaming "Chris! Help me! Help me!", like literally blood curdling scream. Meanwhile I'm relaxing, watching an animal documentary, completely fine. He on the other hand looks like he's about to have a heart attack.  My mother, who I take care of, comes downstairs the next day asking where my dad is? I have no idea what she's talking about. She insists I yelled for her upstairs and told her my dad was here and that I made coffee-a common thing I say, but hey I didn't. I was in the bathroom and he wasn't here.  Now the most upsetting thing to me is the very next day, I go with my mom to pick up my daughter at the bus stop. She's running late and another parent who is new to busing her child this year is standing with us and getting nervous about the bus being late. My mom gets a text from my daughter saying they got held up in traffic but are on French street where we pick her up and will be there soon. We show the worried mom next to us the text and in a few more minutes they arrive. I tell my daughter I was thankful she had her phone, because I was able to let this worried mom who waited with us know they were coming soon. My daughter has no idea what I'm talking about. She says she never texted and was listening to music the whole time. My mom and me tell her we have the text to prove it. Sure enough that text is gone now. Even the mom we showed the text to that they were on the way is confused. We all swear we saw my daughters text, now it never existed.
It's Just a Truck 	My grandfather died in 2019 after 4 years of wasting away with a terrible illness. On his deathbed he was adamant we were to get his pickup truck after his passing.  We've all been terribly protective over this truck, it was his baby. He bought it brand new in 2006 and only put 45,000 miles on it in the time he had it. He always made sure it was fully up to par and maintained. Not a scratch on it.  Shortly after we received it, my mother and I were waiting in a CVS drive thru when an old beat up Ford rolled into the back of us. Not terribly hard, but enough to dent the bumper pretty damn good.  It was an older gentleman, and he was apologizing profusely. He explained he had just gotten out of the hospital and had been looking for some paperwork on his passenger seat and hadn't realized the truck was rolling. He was obviously exhausted and unwell. When we exchanged insurance, it became even more apparent this man had fallen on hard times.  My mother and I didn't really want to go after this guy, it was obvious he was very poor. But we also had guilt over my grandfather's truck now having a terrible dent in the bumper and though it was cosmetic the repairs would be at least $300 and we don't have that kind of money.  That night for the first and last time I dreamed of my grandfather. He was healthy with a beer in his hand and we were sitting in the backyard of his house. We made small talk and eventually he asked if we were enjoying the truck. I told him what happened and he chuckled, took a sip of his beer and said, "You know, it's just a truck." I woke up after that.  That day my mother told me she decided not to go after the guy and when I asked why she said that I may have thought it was silly, but that night she had dreamed of my grandfather, sitting in his backyard with a beer in hand, smiling, and telling her not to worry about it. "It is just a truck."
My friend and I were rescued by entities in the Texas Panhandle. 	My friend and I were rescued from the ditch during a snowstorm by little phantom people. While returning to New Mexico from a visit to my friend's family in Iowa we were caught in a snowstorm on the Texas Panhandle. We were on Highway 60 right outside of a town called Canadian when we went off the road in his little Honda car. We tried digging it out and using the floormats for traction but to no avail. We could see what appeared to be the lights of a farmhouse nearby and although it was 2:00 a.m. we elected to knock on the door and see if we could get help instead of freezing to death in a rare Texas blizzard out in the middle of nowhere. A tiny old woman answered the door, and I mean tiny. Four foot something and ancient to boot. We explained that we were stuck and needed a pull out of the ditch and how far to the next town etc. Her tiny (maybe five foot something) ancient husband came out and said he'd pull us out with Zuzu and to follow him to the barn. Out in the barn was an old Ford highboy with a CB radio and a .357 revolver in the front seat pocket. We all climbed in the cab, he rubbed the the dash and said "come on Zuzu" and proceeded to take us to where we had gone off road and yanked the little car out with no problem. We made it to Canadian and stayed in the nastiest roach motel I had ever been in, and slept on top of the covers with all my clothes on. The next day we drove back to New Mexico with no other incidents. Since I was on Hwy 60 pretty regularly I figured I'd stop in during the day and drop off a gift and say thanks next time I was in the area. The problem is that right outside of Canadian TX on Hwy 60 near that curve, there is no house. No little old people. No barn, no Zuzu either. I've driven by there a dozen times since we went off the road that night in December and I've pulled up the area on Google Maps and there is just no trace of them. My buddy and I just concluded that guardian angels got us unstuck from the snow and vanished.  
My grandfather visited me the night I made it one year sober. 	I have to explain some things first.  My grandfather was an alcoholic. He began drinking during the war (WWII) at age 22 due to combat stress and got sober in his early 50s after immigrating to America.  I never knew him as an alcoholic as he was well sober by the time I was born into this world but I had heard brutal stories from my mother and aunts.  I always felt incredibly connected to him. My mother and aunt used to remark all the time about how similarly I carried my mannerisms and speech. I would and still do have unexplainable dreams of him and his experiences both during his life and after he passed.  Once he had died, my Mom and Aunt would cry any time I would remind them of him because of their own grief.  Fast forward to my own life.  I began drinking at age 18 and by 24 had developed a pretty bad drinking problem that directed me to several near death experiences and hospital trips. It was burning down everything it touched in my life.  By the time I was 28 it had reached an all time low and I was finally at my wits end.  My options were to quit or die or kill myself.  One thing my grandfather did frequently when I was growing up was offer me loose change (usually pennies) as a joke and then promptly give me a crisp $20 bill as the big reveal.  After he died I felt like I would find heads up pennies in strange places at odd times. Pennies I swore I didn’t recognize as being there before. This became something my mother and I enjoyed reporting to each other about. It was a fun way to think of him although I am very skeptical of these kinds of things and not really a believer in the paranormal. Despite that, I loved calling my mom up to tell her that I’d find a heads up penny moments after getting a raise at work and other events of that nature.  The night was August 9 2018.  My fiancé and I were staying up waiting for midnight to come because at midnight I would finally, finally be free of addictions bondage and have my first full year completely dry. Something I could only have dreamed of before then.  We were sitting on the couch reminiscing of the hard times and the good times. We were just holding each other and laughing...sometimes crying too. It was a wonderful evening.  Finally my alarm on my phone went off signifying it was midnight and that my victory had arrived.  About half a second to a full second after I silenced the alarm....we heard a coin hit the floor in the kitchen.  It startled both of us. My fiancé in particular jumped because the house was silent.  I got up and walked over to the kitchen and there on the floor seemingly grinning at me was a heads up penny. The shock and disbelief and feelings of utter warm joy cannot be described in this post.  I felt as if my skeptic world and connection with reality had glitched in such a way that I had never experienced before and still have not experienced since.  I sat down on the couch and immediately dialed my mother. To my surprise she answered immediately and said she had also been waiting up for midnight to come so she could call me and congratulate me.  I stopped her abruptly and explained to her in sharp detail what had just happened and said I had my fiancé sitting with me as my witness. A silence came over the line followed by my mother sobbing into the phone.  *”Oh daddy....daddy....” she sobbed into the phone.  We both sat there on the line, crying, laughing and embracing the warm feeling of the moment.  Ever since this night I have stopped finding pennies in strange places. I don’t know fully what really happened but I sure do think of it every day.  This August I will be 3 years bone dry sober and I am set to marry my best friend this summer.
Skeptic for years until this morning... 	I work with one other person closely throughout most work days and today we get to work early as we knew we had to get stuff done before the snow hit. I work at a burial vault manufacturer and we deliver and set up funerals graveside if the customer wishes.  Well on this morning I walk to the back and turn on the lights to each section of the shop and on the very last switch I turn it on and I see an older gentleman facing away from me leaning against the back wall facing the back of the shop.  It startled me and I turned around to ask my co worker that there’s someone in the shop. My co worker kind of laughs as I tell him and he says “oh so you saw him did you” . Apparently it’s the owners father who has strong ties to the workplace and has been dead for 10 years. 3 recorded sightings of him and mine was the 4th. I’m fairly new there so this completely caught me off guard  I felt like I was dreaming. I had to sit in the bathroom for 10 mins to calm down, I literally saw someone back there and then disappear. I’ve always thought ghosts and spirits were b.a bit this has completely turned me sideways. I see life in a whole new way.  I can’t stop thinking about him though. Those blue overalls and white hair with a cap on. Clear as day right there and it was a ghost. My co worker telling me he saw him too has turned me into a believer because I know I’m not losing my mind.
My older brother told me where to find my missing tv remote last night, he has been deceased since 2011. 	Last week my wife and I attended a wedding and had to have a sitter watch the kids overnight. When we returned home, everything was fine except that the remote for the living room had gone missing. Usually when this happens it is stuck in no man’s land under the couch but I could not find it anywhere. I actually gave up and ordered 2 more remotes off of eBay. Problem solved right?  So last night right before I got up to go to bed, my son came out of his room and asked if he could sleep with his mom so I told him yes, and got the couch ready to sleep on. While I was asleep, I had the first dream of my deceased brother since he passed in 2011. In the dream he was holding my remote in his hand and saying he was sorry for making me spend money(he knows I don’t like to waste on things I didn’t need) and that he would “put the remote back where it usually is. The first thing I did when I woke up this morning was to check the spot that he told me in the dream and it was there. I had checked that spot at least once a day since it went missing.  Thanks Jeff, I’ll return those new remotes as soon as they arrive.  Edit: Guys, when I told my wife about the dream and showed her the remote she started crying. Between her and I, that spot in the couch was checked and rechecked at least 20 times. I also told my sister about it and she was ecstatic because he would mess with both of us when we were kids by hiding things in really tough spots until he was sure that we had looked everywhere and then put it in an obvious spot when we weren’t around. This is like classic Jeff.  Edit: PLEASE STOP ASKING ME TO MAKE YOUTUBE VIDEOS ABOUT THIS STORY!
My friend seems to be gone off the face of the planet 	Hello Reddit  I’m on a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Most people I bring this up to cry fake, or think I’m insane, so please forgive me.  So I am currently 21 years old, and up until recently I had not experienced anything that I would call “supernatural”. I’m still not sure what to think of the supernatural/paranormal, but this really freaked me out:  I don’t know if something brought it on, but I was out with my friends when I suddenly started thinking about the past, particularly about my childhood friend, Brendan.  We went to Elementary and Middle school together, and when I was remembering this, I just assumed that he went to a different highschool than me and we drifted apart.  So I decide that I’m going to track him down and reconnect with him, right?  But I can’t find any of his social media’s, or information about him online. And then I sort of forgot about it for awhile.  Then about a month ago, I was out with another one of my friends, (We’ll call her Amy) whom I’d known since elementary school as well, and I ask her if she’s been in contact with Brendan or if she know how to get ahold of him.  She seems to hesitate, but when I mentioned his last name she remembered. She told me she hadn’t spoken to him in probably 8 years, but remembered his parents’ address.  So I drive over there, seeing as it’s not actually that far away. Then his parents open the door, and I recognize them.  So they say hi to me, and invite me inside. I introduce myself and they remark on how much I’ve grown, and then they say that they don’t have a son.  I immediately assumed that maybe he had gotten into drugs or something, and they disowned him. But no, they insist that they do not have a son at all, just two daughters. (Whom I vaguely recognize/remember, but there’s no doubt that this is his family).  I ended up outright accusing them of lying and they got really defensive. So I just apologized and went home.  I don’t think I got the wrong house, I recognized them and they recognized me. But regardless, I phoned Amy and told her what happened, and asked her if she was sure this was their address.  I stopped thinking about it for a little while, until about two weeks ago Amy texted me saying that he wasn’t in any of her yearbooks. And sure as shit, I check mine and he’s not there.  We met up a few days ago and we both went in separate rooms to draw what we thought Brendan looked like, just in case he was a shared hallucination. But no. We both came back with drawings that looked almost the same, down to the way he parted his hair, and the location of his three face moles.  So in the last few days we’ve both been going down a rabbit hole of talking to old teachers, friends, etc: and I swear to god it’s like he never existed.  We even went down to our old middle school to see if he was in any of the class photos, and nothing.  I also got some old birthday photos from my mom, and on most of those birthdays I am 100% certain Brendan was there. But again, nothing.  Not even my parents remember him.  Me &amp;amp;amp; Amy want to check hospital records for some kind of birth certificate or anything, but it’s really starting to scare both of us.  Is there some kind of explanation for this, supernatural or otherwise?  If it were just me I’d think I dreamed him up, but Amy pointed out the “correct” Address, and we both came up with near identical drawings of him.  Edit: I don’t think we’re mistaking his appearance for someone else’s either, because his facial markings were pretty distinct and he got bullied for it in elementary school.  .  .  Update One  I will keep on updating this post with more information as we look. Me &amp;amp;amp; Amy are planning to go back to his house tomorrow so we can ask more questions, and show them the “composite sketches” me and Amy did.  We’ll be exploring the possibility that Brendan was a foster kid, and we want to take a look at his bedroom.  Also, I’ve become aware that birth certificates are public record, so I’ll be looking for a birth certificate tommorow.  At this point I don’t know wether he’s a missing person, or if he never existed at all. Should I possibly talk to the police? I’m not sure.  .  .  Update Two  A lot of people are theorizing that’s Brendan is trans, and that’s why his parents insisted they had two daughters, but I don’t think that’s the case. Brendan had two sisters, so if he transitioned then his parents would’ve said they had three daughters.  Someone also suggested that me &amp;amp;amp; Amy draw a map of where his room is in the house, so that when we go there we can test again to make sure this isn’t a shared hallucination or something. Amy doesn’t remember the exact layout of his house, but claims to remember A) the side of his room where his closet was, and B) what side the window was. So we’ll be comparing that instead.  Also, on the topic of going back to his house, his parents do like me. They remember who I am, but according to them I was a friendly neighbourhood kid who would babysit for them, not Brendan’s friend. (Which is strange, because I don’t think I’ve ever babysat at all). So I don’t think they would be offended to see me again, despite how our last interaction went.  Some people also don’t believe that we both remembered his moles, but trust me, they’re very big, and distinct.  Also, some people are talking about similar stories they’ve seen— Please link them! Also, if something like this has happened to you, message me.  .  .  Update Three  So we went back to visit Brendan’s parents, and we told them that we’ve been looking for Brendan, and what we remember. I’m pretty sure they thought we were crazy, but they did cooperate. We also showed them the sketches we did, asked them if they had ever fostered kids, or whatever. Nothing.  They agreed to let me tour the house, but not Amy. (I guess because they didn’t know her). And first of all, Amy and I were right about the location of A) his bedroom window, and B) his closet. According to his parents, it’s just a sore bedroom though.  There isn’t a single photo of him in the house, either. I don’t think his parents are lying. They honestly don’t seem to think they have a son.  I also asked them more about our relationship, how I knew them and how they knew me. But they didn’t really give any new information. I babysat, helped out around the house, etc: and that was it.  Because of corona, we won’t be going to the hospitals near us for the time being. But birth certificates are public record, so maybe there’ll be some other way to check.  We’ve already contacted old teachers, classmates, etc: and they don’t know anything about Brendan.  I’m sorry I don’t have any answers. A lot of you are proposing theories of alternate timelines and whatnot, and as much of a skeptic as I am, I’m starting to believe that this may be some kind of case of timeline jumping.  I’ve sent my mom the drawings that we did, and I will update this when she responds back to them.  Also, some people are understandably skeptical that me and Amy can both draw, but we both attend art classes together so we know how to render a human face.  Also: Amy is indeed real. I’ve seen her have conversations with other people, and people know who I’m talking about when I talk about Amy. Unless everyone I know is fake (which is not the case), then Amy is 100% real.  .  .  Update Four  So I’m pretty well at a dead end and I think it may be time to give up. A lot of you have put forth the alternate timeline theory, and I’m sort of leaning on that as the answer, but there’s no real way to know. I apologize that this story doesn’t really have a conclusion, but I guess that’s how it is.  My mom did reply back to me, I’ve been texting her for the last hour and a half. She has no idea who the person me and Amy drew is, and I also brought up to her my supposed babysitting for Brendan’s parents, and she says she remembers me occasionally doing that. I do not remember this.  Some people have poked holes in my story, and I suppose that’s understandable. I didn’t expect this post to garner so much attention, and I left out some details initially. So to address your concerns:  How did we both A) remember what he looked like 8 years ago, and B) have the artistic skill to draw him?  Me and Amy both attend university level Art classes, and know how to render a human face.  Brendan’s facial markings (moles) are very distinct, and that’s why we remembered them.  Why are his parents ok with me coming over repeatedly?  They weren’t entirely ok with Amy being there, but they do like me.  I acknowledge that I was a little intrusive both times I was over, but I don’t think they would suddenly do a 180 and never allow me back there again.  How did me and Brendan not stay in contact after middle school?  We were inseparable in Elementary school, as said before, but started to drift apart in Middle. I guess we just stopped putting in the effort to see each other when high school started.  To further separate us, partway through my first year, me and my mom moved across our city.  I can already see why people would be confused that I now live near his parents again. To answer that question in advance, I now live on campus, near(ish) his house.  This reads like fiction.  I’m not sure how to explain this one. I wanted to tell the story with all the relevant details, and putting them in chronological order was only natural.  Maybe I’m just good at telling stories, fiction or non-fiction?  How can you run around like this in the middle of COVID?  I have to admit that I haven’t really been taking social distancing too seriously. Nobody in my area is, really.  Most schools are still open here, but on a reduced schedule.  This sounds like a post I read X amount of time ago.  If multiple timelines are a thing, it wouldn’t surprise me if I wasn’t the only one this has happened to.  You’re copying and pasting answers.  A lot of people ask the same questions, and with so many people to respond to, it makes engaging in conversation a whole lot easier to cut and paste responses. I’m sorry if this comes across as disingenuous, I just don’t want to ignore people.  Why use a throwaway?  People outside of Reddit know about my account and I don’t want this attached to my main.  Why didn’t you remember his address?  I barely remember my own address. I’m not good at remembering names, or in this case, addresses. I remember things other ways, like how to get to places from my house. (Ex: I pull out of the parking lot, make two rights, one straight ahead, then a left.)  Why did Amy only remember once you said his last name?  I don’t think it’s that she forgot Brendan, or that she only remembered because I said his last name, i’m pretty sure she’s just didn’t know who I was talking about at first.  If this was real, and you honestly thought there was some dimension hopping going on, wouldn’t you want to investigate further?  I have a life. And I’m not going to dedicate that life to finding a person who either A) doesn’t exist in this timeline, or B) has gone to extensive lengths not to be found.  Why won’t you post the sketches?  As stated, I’m pretty sure he doesn’t exist. But on the off chance he does, I’m sure he has a reason for disappearing and trying to make it look like he never existed. I don’t want to expose him if this is the case.  (I’m sure there’s more, I will edit to answer other concerns)
I am still processing this... 	I drive for Uber and I stopped at this house a few hours ago. As I'm waiting, a light turned on upstairs and this little boy was turning the lights on, waiving at me, then turning them off. He did it a few times and was smiling and looked like he may be laughing. I waved back and smiled and even though it was late, I didn't even question it. The girl got in my car a few minutes later. I thought she took so long because the kid was hers and I commented how cute the kid upstairs was and her face went pale. She looked me straight in the eye and told me no one lives upstairs. I laughed because it's spoopy season and I thought she was messing with me. I stopped shortly after I looking in the rearview mirror and saw that she was...starting to cry. She took a few deep breaths and asked me what I saw. So, I told her about the little boy turning on the lights. She called her boyfriend who was still there and was full on freaking out. Turns out her boyfriend had several people mention the kid that plays with the lights and waves!  I would have thought it was a joke, but she was shaking and almost had a panic attack about this. Her boyfriend was woken up by the call and the entire downstairs was dark when I picked her up. I have no other explanation for this because of her reaction. My hair is still standing on end thinking about it.  Edit: Thanks for the award! I honestly didn't think this story would be received so well!  Oh my goodness! Thank you all so much for the awards! I'm blown away.  For those worried about the child and suspect foul play, I did place a call to the local police and they did confirm that there is no child at the residence, although they wouldn't tell me if the upstairs apartment was occupied or vacant. I am driving again tonight so I will try to stop by on a break and see if it happens again. If it does, I will have my camcorder to try and capture anything out of the ordinary. I could not hear anything but he did seem like a little kid that was having fun and being goofy rather than being in any distress. I have been around enough kids to tell the difference as I used to work in a daycare. Thanks again for your enthusiasm! This isn't my first encounter like this and am trying to capture more and more! I hope to share more in the future.  UPDATE So I went back to the house. I sat there for a bit and nothing happened. With the moon being so bright (it was really cloudy yesterday) I could sort of see into the window where I saw him. The lady wasn't kidding, there is nothing up there. No photos or furniture that could be seen. The apps on the second floor but it is has those long windows that almost reach the floor. Anyway, there was no movement inside. However, as I started to drive away I saw a kid in the yard running...but there was no noise to it...no crunching leaves or anything. I had my window open, radio off, I would be able to hear footfalls or at the very least the shuffling of leaves. It was just a glimpse and I waited for something else but there was nothing. I think it is safe to say that there is something on that property. I have to look into the history of the property. It is a really rough part of the city and many many people die in that area yearly, but I am still curious that turns up.
My son, my grandma, and a place called Kryptodon. 	My grandma lived to be 99 years old and passed about 8 years ago. I’m now in my 40’s and to this day I’ve never quite felt a connection to another human being as I shared with her. My wife was around 2 months pregnant with our first child when I had gotten word that my grandma wasn’t doing so well. I was crushed that she likely wouldn’t be able to meet my firstborn child. At this point I lived across the country from where my grandma was, just started a new career, and my mom told me my grandma had developed bad dementia and suggested it was okay to stay home and handle my priorities vs. seeing her in this state. I ultimately decided to stay home to help my pregnant wife. My grandma hung on for a couple months, then passed, and a few months later our son was born. Now this is an important detail for later: my son has these insanely piercing bright blue eyes and platinum blonde hair.  Fast forward 6 months or so and I’m in my son’s room one night, trying to get him to sleep. He was in his crib and suddenly turned his head a bit to look up towards the corner of the ceiling, almost as if startled. Then he started laughing hysterically... like so hard he could barely catch his breath. I’m following his line of sight and looking up there... there are no nearby pictures or decorations up there, just a blank wall in that corner of the room. The next day it happened again, so I went to get my wife from the other room so she could see how hard he was laughing. She told me that he was doing the same thing during the day the whole week while I was at work. It became a regular occurrence multiple times a day and borderline creepy because he was clearly seeing something up there.  A couple months later my mom came to visit. One night she’s helping me get my son ready for bed and we get into a conversation about my grandma’s last days, particularly how her dementia was getting worse and worse as it went on until this one specific day.  Here’s the first kicker: she tells me this one day she goes to visit my grandma and she’s in bed, her feet dancing back and forth with a huge smile on her face. And it’s the first somewhat normal conversation they have in about a month. Mom: Wow, you’re so happy today! Grandma: Yeah, my friend came to visit me again. Mom: Who’s that? Grandma: The boy with the penguins. Mom: Oh is he a boy visiting someone in the nursing home? Grandma: No, he lives in there. (Then she points to the corner of the room near the ceiling. To humor her, my mom asks what he looks like.) Grandma: The boy with the blue eyes and white-blonde hair, he’s going to visit me everyday now.  At this point my jaw is practically on the floor. She proceeds to tell me how from that day forward it’s all my grandma will talk about. Every single day until the day she dies, a blue-eyed blonde boy with penguin friends who lives on a tropical island inside the wall pops in to visit her.  I then tell my mom about my son and the giggling and the ceiling. We’re both shocked at the coincidence, and I ask what’s with the penguins. My mom has no clue, neither do I.  I WANT to believe at this point my grandma and son had some sort of otherworldly connection. But the rational side of me is like... she had dementia, babies do weird stuff sometimes and penguins and tropical islands make no sense.  But here’s the second kicker and I can’t deny it after this:  Fast forward, my son is roughly 4 & 1/2. Out of the blue he starts talking about this place where he used to live before he was born called Kryptodon every single day. (This is my best interpretation of spelling it). He says Kryptodon is like a planet, but not near Earth and where people can fly and animals talk (among many other details). I listen to his stories about it and am happy he has a big imagination.  At this point I had forgotten about the penguins. One day I’m going through an old photo album and see a pic of my grandma. I call my son over to come see the picture and this is the first time I’m EVER showing him a picture of my grandma. He says, “I know her, she’s my friend from Kryptodon.” My hair stands up and I ask him to tell me more about her and he says, “she came over and ate pineapples with me and my penguins on my island when I lived there”.  I then burst into tears as the details of my mom’s story came rushing back to me. I feel like the probability of all this being only coincidence is nearly impossible. I don’t know what it all means but I’m grateful to be able to finally share this, thanks for reading.  EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the positive responses. I’ve always been hesitant to put this out there because it is very personal to me. My son is now 7 years old and rarely talks about Kryptodon, and if I ask he says he remembers and will acknowledge it, just with nowhere near the level of detail he once did.  I left out so, so many details to try and keep the post short. He drew literally 100’s of pictures of it and I’ve saved most in a binder. He talked about it for hours at a time on a daily basis until he was around 6. He asked me once if I remember being there, I said no and he said “we’ve travelled together for a long, long time.” I asked how long and he said, “higher than people can count.” He also claimed he was once my dad a long time ago.  My wife bought him a stuffed animal when he was a newborn, a gray elephant. He named it Ellie when he was older, and told us that there was an elephant on his island that taught people to travel to other places. And that since his mom gave him the stuffed elephant, that’s how he knew he was in the right place. I know this ultimately proves nothing... but I will say when you’re a parent, you know the difference when you see your child speak with true conviction. Thanks again.
